# LIFERAY-DOCS

<!-- Icon here -->

Welcome to Liferay's official documentation repository, home to
[Liferay Developer Network](https://dev.liferay.com) articles. You can
contribute new articles and submit fixes for existing articles in this
repository. The articles are written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) text for
uploading to the Liferay Developer Network. To render article drafts as HTML
locally, you can execute a [`convert`](bin/) script. You have style guidelines
for [writing](guidelines/writers-guidelines.markdown) and following
[Markdown conventions](guidelines/writers-guidelines.markdown), to
produce documentation that is comprehensive and consistent. 

## Structure

All of the [Liferay Developer Network](https://dev.liferay.com) articles map to
logical folders in the liferay-docs repository. Each folders under discover,
develop, and distribute represents a section of articles. For example, the
discover/portal folder contains article Markdown files and images that are the
source for the
[Discover&rarr;Portal](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal) section of
Liferay Developer Network. 

To contribute new articles, and images, to the 
[Discover](https://dev.liferay.com/discover) or
[Develop](https://dev.liferay.com/develop) sections of Liferay Developer
Network, commit them to the respective `new-articles` folder.
