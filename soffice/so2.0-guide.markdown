# Introduction

Liferay Social Office is a dynamic team collaboration solution for the enterprise that's designed to streamline communication, save time, and raise productivity. Organizations and groups can use Social Office to share resources, collaborate on projects, and publicize important activity. Social Office features a robust suite of integrated, easy-to-use web applications. It's ready to use right out of the box. Once installed, a quick setup wizard will help you set up a team collaboration site so you can begin working immediately. Let's take a look at some of Social Office 2.0's new features. Then we'll explain how to install Social Office.

## New Features

- Social Office 2.0 is deployable on top of Liferay Portal 6.1. This means that your Social Office 2.0 installation includes not only the following new applications but also all the new features of Liferay 6.1. Please see [http://www.liferay.com/web/james.falkner/blog/-/blogs/11927282](http://www.liferay.com/web/james.falkner/blog/-/blogs/11927282) for details about the new Liferay 6.1 features.

- The Dashboard is the default private home page for Social Office users. It's designed to help you manage your personal tasks and communication. The Dashboard features some personal applications such as the microblogs portlet, activities portlet, upcoming tasks portlet, events portlet, site portlet, as well as links to other personal pages and applications.

- Social Office sites can be quickly created and set up based on the *Default Social Office Site* template. If you click on the *Add Site* button on the Dashboard, a wizard pops up to help you create a new Social Office site pre-built with pages and applications.

- Social Office users receive a *Notifications* button on the Dockbar that's integrated with the portal. The Nofications button displays how many unread notifications you have. You'll be notified upon receiving a private message, site invitation, social connection request, or event reminder.

- The Contact Center can be very important for large organizations or groups using Social Office. It allows users to manage their social contacts the way that LinkedIn or Twitter users can. You can add users as connections, follow users, or even block users.

- The Microblogs portlet allows users to post Facebook-like status to a chosen scope: to all portal users, to connections only, or to followers only. It also contains a Timeline tab which displays all the microblog entries that you have permission to see.

- The Dashboard contains an improved Sites portet. Unlike the basic My Site portlet, the improved Sites portlet allows you to star various sites to customize your sites list. You can view choose to view all sites, sites you belong to, or your favorite (starred) sites. The option to star sites can be very convenient for large Social Office instances with web applications and content hosted across many different sites.

## Installation

Social Office is available as a plugin for Liferay Portal 6.1. It can be installed via Liferay Marketplace.

## Using the Dashboard

The Dashboard home page is only available to Social Office users. Note that Liferay Portal identifies users as Social Office users based on whether or not they have been assigned to the Social Office User role. We recommend that you add this role to your portal's default user associations configuration in the control panel. Use the *Go to* menu of the Dockbar to navigate to the Control Panel. Under the Portal heading, click on *Portal Settings*. Then click on *Users* from the right-hand navigation menu. Finally, open the *Default User Associations* tab and add the role *Social Office Users*. Now, newly created users will be assigned to the Social Office User role.
