# Maintaining Ambiguity on the TISA Web Site

As you know, the TISA site has to be a prime example of semantic ambiguity. For this reason, the following guidelines are in place for users of the site, in order to make sure that specificity is stamped out. 

    1. Tags are to be used on the site, but we should have only a few of them. Some good tags to use are file, stuff, thing, or bytes. 
    2. Specific titles are unnecessary. Refer to each other as he, she, dude, dudette, or yo. 
    3. Use unspecific text where you can. Like, you know, whatever. 
    4. If you're unsure, you're on the right track. Good job! 
    
Now go and be a great example of ambiguity!
