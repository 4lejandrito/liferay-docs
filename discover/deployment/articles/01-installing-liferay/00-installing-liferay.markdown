#  Installation and Setup

Liferay Portal is one of the most flexible applications on the market today
with respect to application server environments. It supports a wide variety of
application servers, freeing you to use the Java application server you think
is best. Liferay also scales very well: you can install Liferay Portal on a
shared hosting account, on a multi-node cluster running a commercial
application server, or on anything in between. In fact, Liferay is used
successfully in all of these scenarios every day.

You'll find that because Liferay is extremely flexible in its deployment
options, it is also easy to install. If you already have an application server,
you can use your application server's deployment tools to install Liferay. If
you don't already have an application server, Liferay provides several
application server bundles from which to choose. These are pre-configured
application servers with Liferay already installed on them. They're very easy
to install and with a small amount of configuration can be made into
production-ready systems.
