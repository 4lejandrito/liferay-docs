# Activating Your DXP Server [](id=licensing-your-dxp-server)

To activate your Liferay DXP server, you must register it with Liferay Connected 
Services (LCS). LCS gives you a convenient central location to activate and 
manage your DXP subscriptions, and more. This section covers the following steps 
to help you get your DXP instance up and running with LCS: 

1. **Downloading the LCS Client App:** In most cases, you won't need to do this. 
   The LCS client app is part of Liferay DXP bundles and autodeploys when the 
   bundle starts. If you installed DXP manually from a WAR file, however, then 
   you must download and install the LCS client separately. There may also be 
   other cases, such as updating the client, where you need to download and 
   install the client separately. You can download the LCS client app 
   [here in the Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/71774947). 
   For instructions on using Marketplace to download and install apps, see 
   [this user guide article](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-the-liferay-marketplace). 

2. [**Preconfiguring the LCS Client to Connect Through a Proxy:**](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/preconfiguring-the-lcs-client-to-connect-through-a-proxy)
   If your server connects to the Internet through a proxy, you must 
   preconfigure the LCS client app before it deploys to your DXP instance. This 
   article shows you how to do this. If your server doesn't connect through a 
   proxy, then you can skip this and proceed to activating your DXP server in 
   the next article. 

3. [**Activating Your DXP Server with LCS:**](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/registering-your-dxp-server-with-lcs)
   Once you've preconfigured (if connecting through a proxy) and installed the 
   LCS client app, you must activate your DXP instance with LCS. This section 
   shows you how to do this. 

Note that to use LCS, you must have an account at 
[Liferay.com](http://www.liferay.com/).
