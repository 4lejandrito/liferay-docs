# Sharing Status with Microblogs

Liferay's Microblogs Status Update and Microblogs apps let you post, receive, 
and share short, 150 character status updates from your personal pages in 
Liferay. This gives you a quick and simple way to interact with your social 
connections and other users. Microblogs Status Update is a very simple app that 
lets you post a status update and displays your most recent post. In addition to 
this functionality, the Microblogs app lets you: 

- View all your posts and those of your social connections. 

- Comment on and share posts. 

- View posts that mention you or contain a specific hashtag. 

Before delving into these details, you should understand where in your Liferay 
instance you'll use these apps.

## Understanding Where to Use the Apps

Note that you must use these apps from your Liferay personal site's pages. By 
default, these pages are called *My Profile* and *My Dashboard*. You can access 
both from the user menu. My Profile is public and serves as your public profile. 
Users and guests can view any apps you add to this page, although app appearance 
and functionality are typically limited. My Dashboard is private and by default 
contains the *My Sites* app. You can add other apps to this page to help you, 
and only you, manage your Liferay experience. You can add the Microblogs Status 
Update and Microblogs apps to both pages, but the apps behave differently 
depending on where they are. If you put them on a public page like My Profile, 
then they only display posts to logged in users. After all, you wouldn't want 
others to make posts on your behalf! The internet is crazy enough without 
granting others that kind of power. Logged in users can, however, comment on 
posts in the Microblogs app. Guests can see the apps, but not their contents. 
Things get a great deal more interesting when you add the apps to a private page 
that only you can access, like My Dashboard. In this case, you unleash the apps' 
full power, and can make and share posts until you're satisfied.
