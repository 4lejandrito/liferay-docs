## Using the Documents and Media Management Bar

Documents and Media lists your current folder's subfolders and file entries. A
*file entry* is the Document Library's representation of a file. It wraps the
file to better leverage it within @product@ and to associate additional
information and metadata with the file. You can display file entries in these 
styles, which you select by clicking the appropriate button in the Management 
Bar:

-   **Icon** (![Icon](../../../../images/icon-icon-style.png)): Shows a 
    rendering of the file. If the file isn't an image, Documents and Media 
    displays a generic image for that file type. Also displayed with each file 
    icon is the file's suffix (e.g., *JPG* for a file ending in `.jpg`), last 
    modification timestamp, name, and status (e.g., *Approved*, *Draft*, etc.). 

-   **Descriptive** (![Descriptive](../../../../images/icon-descriptive-style.png)): 
    Shows the same information as the icon display style, in a list with small 
    file renderings. 

-   **List** (![List](../../../../images/icon-list-style.png)): Shows the same 
    information as the icon display style, in a list with no file renderings. 
    Also, the file information is in columns. 

In all display styles, each file has an Actions menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)). These actions are also
available in the file entry's view, which you'll see soon.

To see the current folder's details click the *Information* icon
(![**i**](../../../../images/icon-information.png)). An area with the folder's 
name appears. It shows the number of items in the folder. It also shows these 
buttons: 

-   **Subscribe** (![Subscribe](../../../../images/icon-star.png)): Get 
    notifications about files added to or modified in the folder. 
-   **Actions** (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)): Lists actions 
    you can perform on the current folder. 

Next to the Information icon and display styles is a *Search* that lets you find 
files by keywords. 

The up and down arrows next to the search let you arrange files and folders in 
ascending or descending order.

To the left of the up and down arrows, the *Order by* selector lets you select 
criteria for ordering the files and folders. You can order them by these 
criteria:

-   Modified date (default)
-   Creation Date
-   Title
-   Number of downloads
-   Size

To the left of the *Order by* selector, another selector menu lets you filter 
the files to display. It contains these options: 

-   **All:** Shows all of the current folder's immediate subfolders and files 
    (default).
-   **Recent:** Shows the most recently modified files.
-   **Mine:** Shows all the current user's files (no matter their folder).
-   **Document Types:** Shows the files of the selected document type. Upon 
    choosing this option, you must select the document type you want from a 
    popup. 

The checkbox on the left-most side of the Management Bar selects all currently 
displayed files/folders. Selecting multiple files/folders lets you act on all of 
them at once. You can also select multiple files/folders individually by using 
the checkboxes for each. When you select a checkbox for one or more files, the 
following action icons appear: ![Action Icons](../../../../images/dm-action-icons.png). 
Describing them from left to right, the X is for canceling file checkout, the 
secured lock is for file check-out, the unsecured lock is for file check-in, the 
arrows are for moving the files, and the trash can is for moving files to the 
Recycle Bin. You can also move selected files to a subfolder via drag and drop. 
File check-out and check-in is explained in
[Collaborating on Files](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/collaborating-on-files).

Note that if a Document Library contains more documents than it can display at 
once, you can use the navigation tool that appears at the bottom of the app's 
window to either switch your view to another page or configure the page to 
display more documents per page.
