## Adding Multiple Documents

There are a few different ways you can add image files, or any file for that
matter. You can add them one at a time or add multiple files simultaneously.
Let's add all the images at once. Click the Add icon and select *Multiple
Documents*. The *Add Multiple Documents* screen appears and displays an area for
dropping files in. You can drag and drop files into the area, or you can browse
for and select multiple files by clicking the *Select Files* button. Use the
method that's easiest for you. As you drop in files or select files, the Add
Multiple Documents screen lists them. On the side of the screen, the *All
Selected Files* section lists several options for the files. You can fill in a
common *Description* for the files. You can also specify a *Document Type* to
apply. Since we're uploading image files, we'll use the *Basic Document* type,
which is the default type. There are also options for
[categorizing and tagging](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/organizing-content-with-tags-and-categories)
the selected files, and assigning them default permissions. We'll tighten up
permissions by clicking the *More Options* link and deselecting all the
permissions. When you're ready to upload the files, click *Publish*. The Add
Multiple Documents screen stays active, ready for you to add more files. When
you're done adding files, click the Back icon
(![Back](../../../../images/icon-back.png)) at the top of the screen. You're 
taken back to the folder you're adding files to.
