# Collaboration [](id=collaboration)

What comes to mind when you think of *collaboration*? 

George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and John Williams collaborated to give us the
thrilling adventure story, fantastic stunt sequences, and an adrenaline pumping
score in the Indiana Jones films. 

Russia, the United States, and other nations combined efforts to launch and
maintain the International Space Station to conduct biological and physical
research that's allowed us to explore Mars, Pluto, and beyond. 

Bono, Bill Gates, and many others join forces anualy at the World Economic Forum
to take on world issues such as poverty and AIDS. 

Now, you might not be a celebrity or a renowned scientist, but you have
important things to accomplish. And no matter whether you're saving lives,
exploring the universe, or entertaining people, you're typically much more
effective doing it with others. As you work together, your collective ability to
communicate ideas, produce rich content, and present content are key components
to successful collaboration. So you better have tools that not only enable you
to get the job done but also integrate with your digital platform. That's where
Liferay's Collaboration Suite comes in. 

The suite resonates with apps and features that foster excellent communication.
Its [Message Boards](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-forums-with-message-boards)
app allows you to engage in forum discussions, questions and answers, and
comments. Chat lets you text teammates online in real time.
[Blogs](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/publishing-blogs)
lets you share your ideas using rich content, so readers can understand them
clearly and respond to them. And all these apps support *mentioning* other
users--tagging them by name to get their attention or give them kudos. 

As you produce documents, videos, and audio files you can store and share them
using the suite's [Documents and Media Library](/participate/liferaypedia/-/wiki/Main/Documents+and+Media).
It not only works with Liferay's built-in repository but also allows you to
integrate with external CMIS repositories and [Google Docs](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/publishing-files#accessing-google-docs). 

Lastly, you can present your ideas and content in a number of different ways.
You and your colleagues can build a wealth of information using
[wikis](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/working-together-with-the-wiki)
and create hierarchies of official documentation in a [knowledge base](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/informing-users-with-the-knowledge-base).
And to more personably publish content, you can post a public blog entry. 

These are just some of the ways the Collaboration Suite helps you communicate,
produce, and present. In short, it empowers you to labor together with others in
doing amazing things!
