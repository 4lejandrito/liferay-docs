# User Management

You know how all these retailers advertise themselves as a “one stop shop” for
anything you want? The idea is they have so much stuff that whatever you're
looking for is probably there. Liferay’s Control Panel is something like
this. If you want to create users, organizations, sites, configure permissions
and plugins and pretty much anything else, you can do it from the Control
Panel. When signed in to Liferay as an administrator, you can access the
Control Panel from the Product Menu by clicking *Control Panel*.

Menu.](../../images/usrmgmt-control-panel.png)

The Control Panel is divided into five main areas: Sites, Users, Apps,
Configuration, and System. The Users section lets you create and manage users,
organizations, user groups, roles, and password policies. If monitoring has been
enabled for your portal, you can also view all of the live portal sessions of
your users from this area of the Control Panel. If the Audit plugins have been
installed from Liferay Marketplace, the Audit section also appears.

<!-- Previous paragraph, make sure the monitoring and audit information is true
still. -->

In this set of articles you’ll learn about managing users. While you could probably get
pretty far into learning about Managing Users in Liferay just by perusing the
Control Panel, there's so much User Management functionality in Liferay that
it's tough to wrap your head around it all. Maybe a limerick can help:

*There's a company in Spain that makes Hula Hoops*<br />
*They placed* ***Users*** *in* ***Organizations*** *and* ***User Groups***<br />
*They assigned them their* ***Roles***<br />
*And set them some goals*<br />
*Made* ***Password Policies*** *that can't be duped*

<!-- Work Monitoring into the limerick -->
