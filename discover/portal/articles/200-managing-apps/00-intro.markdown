# Managing Apps [](id=managing-apps)

Apps are the central focus of @product@. For example, the web experience 
management, collaboration, and business productivity features all consist of 
apps. Even the Control Panel consists of apps that let you configure @product@ 
to your liking. You can also add to or change built-in functionality by 
installing other apps. There are several ways to manage, find, and install apps. 
This section covers these topics, and more.
