# Collecting Information from Users

Collecting information from your site's Users is important, whether you're
asking them to submit a brief survey or apply for a mortgage. In either case,
you need to design a form. Liferay gives you almost limitless form building
capability with the Forms application.

Because the complexity of use cases for the Forms application varies from
needing only one basic input field, to needing many pages of fields with many
different configurations. What, you want more detail? Okay, here's some of the
what the Forms app can do right now (yeah, there's even more planned for future
releases):

- Populate a Select or Radio field with a REST Data Provider
- Make a field appear based on the value entered into another field
- Add extra pages to the form
- Enable CAPTCHA for a form
- Store results in JSON
- Enable workflow for the form
- Redirect to a different URL after a successful form submission
- Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
- Provide a default value (entered if left alone by the user) or a placeholder
  value (not entered if left alone by user) for each field
- Validate fields using a number of different criteria

If you only need a very basic form, don't worry. Despite this seemingly long
list of more complex behavior, it's really easy to develop a simple, elegant
form to suit your more basic needs. The next article will cover these basic
scenarios, and will be followed by a more complete, complex tutorial on the
Forms app.
