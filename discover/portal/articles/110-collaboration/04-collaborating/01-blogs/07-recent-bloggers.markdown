# Highlighting Recent Bloggers

The Recent Bloggers app lets you highlight the work of your site's most recent 
blog authors. This app lists each recent author's name, profile picture, and 
number of posts. You can add the Recent Bloggers app to a page from the 
*Collaboration* category in the *Add* 
(![Add](../../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) &rarr; *Applications* menu. 

To access the app's configuration options, click *Configuration* from the 
*Options* menu 
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) in the app's title bar. 
The *Setup* tab appears first: 

-   **Selection Method:** Set how the app selects blogs authors to highlight. 
    You can choose *Users* or *Scope*. If you select Users, the app aggregates 
    every recent blogger on your system. To refine the aggregation, you can 
    select an organization by which to filter the users. If you select Scope, 
    the app aggregates the recent bloggers in the current scope. This limits the 
    entries to members of the site where the app resides. 

-   **Organization:** The organization whose recent bloggers you want to 
    aggregate. 

-   **Display Style:** Select how the app displays recent bloggers: 
    *User Name and Image*, or *User*.

-   **Maximum Bloggers to Display:** Select the maximum number of recent 
    bloggers the app displays. 

Here are descriptions for the other tabs in the app's configuration: 

-   **Sharing:** Embed the application instance as a widget on any website, 
    Facebook, Netvibes, or as an OpenSocial Gadget. 

-   **Scope:** Specify the blog instance the app displays: the current site's 
    blog (default), the global blog, or the page's blog. If the page doesn't
    already have a blog instance, you can select scope option *\[Page Name\]
    \(Create New\)* to create a page-scoped blog instance. 

When you're finished setting the options, click *Save*. Then close the dialog
box.
