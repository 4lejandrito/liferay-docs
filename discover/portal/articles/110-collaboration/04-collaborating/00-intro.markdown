# Collaborating [](id=collaborating)

@product@ ships with a robust suite of collaboration apps that your users can 
leverage to get things done and form extensive communities. These apps provide 
all the features that you would expect of standalone apps outside a portal. 
@product@'s collaboration apps, however, all share a common look and feel, 
security model, and architecture. You can use them in combination with 
@product@'s user and content management features to build a well-integrated, 
feature-rich site.
