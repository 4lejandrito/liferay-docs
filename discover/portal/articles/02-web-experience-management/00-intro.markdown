# Web Experience Management [](id=web-experience-management)

**Experience**; consider that word for a moment. Not the type of experience you
gain with repetition, but the contact or encounter you have with something. For
example, if your hiking in the woods and are mauled by a black panther, this
would be considered a *bad* hiking experience. Suppose you travel to your local
food market and someone gives you a large amount of money for no reason other
than to be nice. This would be considered a *great* grocery shopping experience.

These two examples are a bit extreme, but it gets the point across of a good vs.
bad experience. Let me tone down the examples to something a little more
practical. Suppose you're a huge sports fan and you're contemplating whether to
buy tickets to the big game next week. What are some of the things you might
consider that would determine whether you attend the game or not? The *price* of
the tickets is usually the most important factor. Others may include parking
accessibility, distance to game, quality of your favorite team, along with
several other factors. To determine whether you attend the game, you weigh the
negative factors, like price and the stadium's nightmarish parking setup, with
the reason you're attending the game, the *experience*. If you expect the
experience of seeing your favorite team play trump the negative factors, you'll
attend. If you expect the experience to be bad, or just worse than the negative
factors you expect to encounter, you'll stay home and watch the game on TV.

Liferay takes the *experience* factor very seriously when it comes to web
management. Just like the sports fan that weighs the experience vs. the live
game headaches, the user/administrator also weighs the experience a web platform
provides. With the apps and features provided with Liferay's Web Experience
Management suite, the management of sites, pages, and content is seamless.

Managing sites and pages is a fundamental pillar of any web site, and Liferay
provides easy-to-use features that make site/page creation quick and easy. Web
Content is another building block upon which most sites rely. With Liferay's web
content apps, you can easily create simple or complex content to display to
viewers of your site. After creating content, Liferay also provides several
innovative ways to publish that content, so users can view your content with
ease. Sometimes your site must adapt on the fly, whether it be for different
holidays or events. A testing environment where you can plan the look and feel
of your pages/content gives you peace of mind in knowing that you won't have to
trial and error your site modifications on a live page.

Just as the die-hard fan knew when buying his tickets to the big game, you can
expect a great and seamless web experience with Liferay.
