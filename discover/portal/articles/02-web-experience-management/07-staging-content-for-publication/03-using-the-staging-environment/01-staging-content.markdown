# Staging Content

When you're on the staged site, you have several options to choose from to help
in your staging conquest.

**Site Pages Variations:** lets you work in parallel on multiple versions of a
staged site page. See the
[Using Site Pages Varitions](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-site-pages-variations)
article for more information.

**Page Variations:** lets you work in parallel on multiple versions of a staged
page. You'll learn more about this later.

**Undo/Redo:** lets you step back/forward through recent changes to a page,
which can save you the time of manually adding or removing apps if you make a
mistake.

**History:** shows you the list of revisions of the page, based on publication
dates. You can go to any change in the revision history and see how the pages
looked at that point. To access *History*, select the *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) in the Staging bar.

**Ready for Publication:** After you're done making changes to the staged page,
click this button. The status of the page changes from *Draft* to *Ready for
Publication* and any changes you've made can be published to the Live Site. When
you publish a page to live, only the version which was *Marked as Ready for
Publication* is published.

When clicking the *Publish to Live* button, a popup window appears with come
configuration options for your publication. You can give your publication a name
and view the changes since last publication. If everything looks good, you can
click the *Publish to Live* button to publish your staged results to the live
site.
