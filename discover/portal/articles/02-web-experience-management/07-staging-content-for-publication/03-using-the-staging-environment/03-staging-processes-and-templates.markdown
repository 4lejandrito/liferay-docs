# Staging Processes and Templates

You can also manage your staging processes. Once staging is enabled, you can
navigate back to the *Staging* option located in the Menu's Publishing tab. From
here you'll see a list of staging processes that have been completed. You can
relaunch or clear any of these publications by clicking the *Actions* button
(![Options](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to a process. If you click
the *Scheduled* tab from above, you'll find staging processes that you've
scheduled for future publication dates.

If you find yourself repeatedly creating staging processes that are very similar
to each other, you should think about using Publish Templates. Up to this point,
you've looked at how to create custom publication processes.

Instead of manually having to customize a publication process every time you're
looking to publish pages/content, you can use a publish template. Using publish
templates provides you the convenience of storing publication process settings so
they can be reused. If you publish content frequently and usually select the same
options to publish, the task of selecting options repeatedly can become tedious.
With publish templates, you can select a custom template and immediately publish
with the options you configured.

To create a publish template, select the *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) from the top right corner of the
Staging screen and select *Publish Templates*. Click the *Add* button (![Add
Publish Template](../../../images/icon-add.png)) and assign the template a name
and description, and then fill out the configuration options as you would during
a custom publication process. Once you've saved your publish template, it is
available to use from the *Publish Templates* tab in the *Publish to Live* menu.
To use the template, click the *Actions* button
(![Options](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to the template and select
*Publish to Live*. This automatically fills the fields and options for
publishing pages and their content. All you have to do is give the publication
process a custom name. Once you confirm the configuration settings, your staging
settings are published.

**Note:** When staging is enabled, the options available from your *Publishing
Tools* tab are modified. When in the Live environment, you're only able to
access the *Export* feature. When in the Staging environment, you're only able
to access the *Import* and *Staging* features. The features that are not
available for each environment don't make sense in that context. For example,
you shouldn't be able to import content when in the live environment; it must be
imported into the staged environment and then published before it is available
in the live site.

Now that you know how to use the staging environment, you'll learn about the
permissions involved to help manage this environment.
