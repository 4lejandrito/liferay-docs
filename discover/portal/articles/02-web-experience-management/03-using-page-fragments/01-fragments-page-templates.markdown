# Building Content Pages with Fragments

Once you have Fragments created, you can start using them to create Content 
Pages. A Content Page is a page which is built entirely from Fragments. You 
can't mix Fragments and Portlets on a single page (though you can embed 
portlets within a Fragment), you'll need to choose between which style of page 
you're going to use when you start creating it. Content Pages must be created 
from Page Templates, and like a Fragment, Page Templates must exist within a 
Collection. For more information on choosing between page types, see our Modern 
Site Building[link] tutorial.

## Creating and Managing Fragments

You can manage Fragments through Site Administration:

1.  Open the main menu.

2.  Under *Site Administration* make sure the Site where you want to work is 
    selected.

3.  In the *Content* section, select *Fragments*.

The main Fragments pages will display any Collections that are available for the current site, provide the option to Import and Export through the menu in the top right, and enable you to create Collections and Fragments. To create a Fragment, you must first create a Collection.

1.  Click the `+` button to add a Collection.

2.  Give the Collection a *Name* and *Description* and click *Save*.

Collections help you organize Fragments, and can be used to differentiate 
between different types of Fragments or Fragments used by different groups or 
departments. Next you want to create a Fragment inside of the Collection you 
created.

1.  Click on the Collection you created.

2.  Click the `+` button to create a Fragment.

3.  Give it a *Name* and click *Submit*.

Now you're looking at the Fragment creation form. Each pane in the editor has a 
different function:

*  The top left pane is for entering HTML.
*  The top right pane is for entering CSS.
*  The bottom left pane is for entering JavaScript.
*  The bottom right pane provides a live preview as you work in the other panes.

For more information on how to create to Fragments, see our Fragment 
Development tutorial.
