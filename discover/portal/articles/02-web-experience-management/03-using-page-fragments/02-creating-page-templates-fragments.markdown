# Creating Page Templates with Fragments

After you create Fragments, your next step is to add them to Page Templates. 
Page Templates are composed of some number of Fragments - it could be one or it 
could be fifty. After a Page Template is created, you can create a Content Page 
from the Page Template.

## Creating a Page Template

You can create Page Templates in the *Site Pages* page in Site Administration.

1.  From Site Administation for your site, go to *Navigation* &rarr; *Site 
    Pages*.

2.  Select the Page Templates tab.

Like Fragments, Page Templates must be created in Collections. You see all of 
your current Collections at the root of the Page Templates page. Next you want 
to create a Page Template.

1.  Click the `+` icon to *Add Collection*.

2.  *Name* your Collection, provide a *Description*, and click *Save*.

3.  Click on the new Collection.

4.  Click the `+` icon from inside of the Collection to *Add Page Template*.

5.  Set the *Name* and click *Submit*.

Now you're on the Page Template creation page. To your right you have a list of
Fragments that are available to be added to the template. They can be dragged, 
dropped and reordered as you need. You can also add the same Fragment to the 
page multiple times.

Clicking on the *Fragments* or *Added* sub-tabs will 
switch between a view of all available Fragments, and a view of all the 
Fragments that have currently been added to the template. The template is 
automatically saved as you edit it, so when you're done working, you can close 
the window or navigate away from the page.

## Creating a Content Page

After you are done creating a Page Template you can use that template to create 
a Content Page. A Content Page is basically a page created from Fragments. 
Unlike most Liferay pages that can be edited directly from the page itself, it 
can only be changed or updated by editing the Template it is based on or the 
Fragments that make up the Template. To create a Content Page:

1.  Go back to the main *Navigation* &rarr; *Site Pages* page.

2.  Click the `+` button for *Add Page*.

3.  Enter a *Name*.

4.  For *Type* select *Content*, and most of the other page creation options 
    will disappear, replaced by a *Page Template* selector.

5.  Choose the *Page Template* you want to use from the selector.

6.  Click *Add Page*
