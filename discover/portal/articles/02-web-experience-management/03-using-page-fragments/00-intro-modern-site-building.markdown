# Using Modern Site Building

Liferay's Modern Site Building is designed to help you collaborate from Design 
to Development to Marketing to create beautiful and purposeful content for your 
site.

Everything starts with Fragments. Fragments are the pieces that you use to 
create complete pages. They comprise HTML, CSS, and Javascript and can 
also include images and other multimedia elements. Fragments are created based 
on requirements given by marketers, interpreted by designs created by 
designers. Using Fragments, you can create many reusable elements which can 
then be used to build out landing pages or other content.

Once Fragments are created, those Fragments can be arranged on Page Templates. 
This is where marketers would take the Fragments provided and arrange them as 
they desire to create pages. For example: you might have several Fragments 
which each contain a description of a particular feature of a product. 
Marketing could arrange several pages which present distinct sets of features 
or test out how visitors respond to seeing the features in different orders.

Of course, before anyone can see the page templates that are created they need 
to be turned into pages and published. You can turn any page template you 
create into a page, and add it to the site through Navigation Menus.

Navigation Menus you say? In @product@ you can now create completely custom 
Navigation Menus which define the layout and hierarchy of a site anyway you 
want to. Navigation Menus can contain, pages, applications, or direct links to 
content or an asset. 

Now we'll look at each feature in depth to see how the whole process works from start to finish.
