# Creating and Managing Site Navigation Menus

So how do you feel about customizability? Spend a little bit of time of the
internet and you'll find tools to customize your car, customize your computer, 
customize your dinner, even customize your hair. In a world of customization 
and flexibility we ask, why not customize your Navigation Menu?

With @product_ver@ you can create and rearrange pages, content, and 
applications with customizable Navigation Menus. Not only can you heavily 
customize a single menu and page hierarchy, you can also create any number of 
menus with different organizations and hierarchies to present your content to
customers any way you choose.

## The Default Menu

The default menu in Liferay functions just like it always has - when you add a page it is added to the menu. You can create subpages and build the page hierarchy out any way you like.

To add a page, do the following:

1.  Go to Site Administration for the site you want to work on.

2.  Click on *Navigation* &rarr; *Site Pages*

3.  Click *Add Page* and fill out the form.

4.  Your page will be added to the site hierarchy.

The site hierarchy as displayed on the *Pages* page is the main reference for the organization of pages on that site. While Navigation menus can customize what appears and what doesn't appear, this menu will always be the "true" reference for the pages on your site.


## Creating Navigation Menus

While you can stick to the default, you can also create multiple, customizable menus to take advantage of different features in Liferay. On the one end, you can create a simplified navigation that leaves some elements of the hierarchy out. This can be useful if when customers arrive at a landing page, you want to provide a simplified version of the site navigation to start with, so you could create a navigation menu which emphasizes the most common or important actions. On the other side, you can create subsidiary menus which expand your navigation and can be placed in addition to your main navigation. For example, a
