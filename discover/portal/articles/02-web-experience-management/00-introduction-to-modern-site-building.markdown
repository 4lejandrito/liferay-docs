# Introduction to Modern Site Building

Some products offer simple easy to use WYSIWYG page and content creation to enable anyone to build a website. Other products provide powerful tools for developers and designers to work together to perfectly realize a vision.
With @product_version@ we ask, "Why not both?"

All of Liferay's powerful, but user friendly content creation tools are available to empower less technical users to create sites without the need to understand web development, and in addition, Liferay's Modern Site Building suite lets experienced web developers get under the hood to create anything they can imagine.

## Liferay Content Management

Whether you're new to Liferay or a Liferay veteran, Liferay's Content Management provides page creation and management, a WSYSIWYG editor, a Media Library, and tools for dynamic content publication. The tools are all designed to be usable for anyone who wants to build a website, but tools like Structures and Templates are also available for developers to provide for more complex content creation.

## Modern Site Building

In addition to having all of the Content Management tools available, Modern Site Building provides a HTML, CSS, and Javascript editor for developers to realize beautiful designs by creating Fragments. Fragments are just that -- fragments of a complete page. Once Fragments are created, you can use them to build Content Pages and deploy them to your site.
