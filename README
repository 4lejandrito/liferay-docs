Documentation Repository Contents
=================================
This repository is intended for storage of Liferay product documentation.
Documents are to be comprised of chapter source files in Markdown format.
Images referenced in the documents are to be stored in the appropriate images
directories.  Document sources are stored in directories for their appropriate
language (e.g. 'en' for English).

Directory Structure
===================
trunk/
 |____ <document dir>/ (e.g. adminGuide)
 |      |____ images/ (default images)
 |            |____ <language dir>/ (e.g. 'en' for English, 'es' for Spanish)
 |                   |____ images/ (override images - language specific)
 |                         |____ chapters/
 |                               |____ [0-9][0-9]-<chapter subject>.markdown
 |____ build.xml
 |____ build.properties
 |____ liferay-book-template.ott
 |____ liferay-book-template-tradepaperback.ott

Document Format Conversion
==========================
Documents can be converted from markdown to HTML and ODT formats using ant and
the targets found in build.xml. To override common properties found in
build.properties, create your own properties file
(e.g. build.<username>.properties) and specify desired property values.

A build directory is created by the targets and holds the Markdown source
file consisting of all of the document's chapters, the image files used,
and the resulting document in its newly converted format.

Required Software
-----------------
* Ant: Required for executing Ant targets.  Download from ...
  http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

* Pandoc: Used in our Ant targets for conversions from Markdown to various
formats. See installation instructions at ...
  http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html

Conversion Steps
----------------
1. Concatenate the chapters into the complete Markdown document.

  Example,
    ant concat-markdown-files -Ddoc.name=adminGuide -Dlang=en

2. Execute the target to produce the desired format of the document.

  Example,
    ant markdown-to-html -Ddoc.name=adminGuide -Dlang=en

  Example,
    ant markdown-to-odt -Ddoc.name=adminGuide -Dlang=en

Results are produced in the respective build/<doc.name>/
  Example,

    trunk/
     |____ build/
            |____ adminGuide/
                   |____ images/
                   |____ adminGuide.html
                   |____ adminGuide.markdown
                   |____ adminGuide.odt
