# What's New in Liferay 6.2 APIs?

<!-- NOTE TO CONTRIBUTERS

Add content describing your API changes. If a section related to your feature
already exists, integrate your content with that section. Otherwise, add a new
section and content describing the your feature's new or modified API. 

Example,

    ## FeatureXYZ

    Describe your new/modified API here

Briefly describe your feature, even if it's an existing feature from the
previous release. Explain what the new or modified API does and whow how to use
it by way of code example. 

If your feature is already described in another chapter of the Dev Guide,
consider describing the API change there instead of here in this chapter. If you
do write about it in another chapter, still mention the API change here in this
chapter and refer to that other chapter and section. That way readers can locate
your API change description from this chapter.

Example,

    ## Message Bus FeatureXYZ

    You can now to x, y, and z in the Message Bus API. See the Using Message Bus
    section of Chapter 6 for details.
