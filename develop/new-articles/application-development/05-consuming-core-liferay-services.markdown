# Consuming Core Liferay Services

Liferay's core services are made available as services in Liferay's module
framework. They are created via the
[Declarative Services](http://wiki.osgi.org/wiki/Declarative_Services)
component model. Declarative Services isn't a dependency injection tool but it
can behave and feel like one. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to invoke a
core Liferay service from your application.
