# Installing Liferay Developer Studio

Liferay Developer Studio is a plugin for Eclipse that provides many
Liferay-specific features and additional enterprise only features. You can
install it into your existing Eclipse environment, or Liferay provides a bundled
version. In this tutorial, you'll learn the different methods available for
installing Liferay Developer Studio.

## Install the Liferay Developer Studio Bundle

1.  Download and install [Java](http://java.oracle.com). @product@ runs on Java,
    so you'll need it to run everything else. Because you'll be developing apps
    for @product@ in Liferay Developer Studio, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is
    required. It is an enhanced version of the Java Environment used for
    developing new Java technology. You can download the Java SE JDK from the
    Java
    [Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    page. 

2.  Download
    [Liferay Developer Studio](https://web.liferay.com/group/customer/dxp/downloads/developer-tools).
    Installing it is easy: unzip it to a convenient location on your system. 

3.  To run Developer Studio, execute the `DeveloperStudioShortcut` executable.

Congratulations! You've installed Liferay Developer Studio! 

## Install Liferay Developer Studio into Eclipse Environment

To install Liferay Developer Studio into an existing Eclipse environment, follow
these steps:

1.  Go to the

3.  In the *Add Site* dialog, click the *Archive* button and browse to the
