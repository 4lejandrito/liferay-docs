# Liferay Mobile SDK Builder [](id=liferay-mobile-sdk-builder)

The Liferay Mobile SDK is great for letting you connect your mobile apps to a 
Liferay instance. By accessing Liferay services through a Liferay Mobile SDK, 
your apps can access the data or functionality in a Liferay instance. But what 
happens when the services you need to use aren't built-in Liferay services? What 
if they're custom portlet services? No problem! In this case, you just need to 
build your own Mobile SDK to access the services of the custom portlets. 

This section describes how to configure your portlet's remote services, set up 
the Mobile SDK builder, and then build a Liferay Android SDK and a Liferay iOS 
SDK. Doing these things makes your custom portlet's services available to your 
mobile apps.
