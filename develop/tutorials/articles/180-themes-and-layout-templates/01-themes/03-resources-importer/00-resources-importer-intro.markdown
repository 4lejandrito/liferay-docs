# Importing Resources with a Theme [](id=importing-resources-with-a-theme)

A theme without content is like an empty house. If you're trying to sell an
empty house, it may be difficult for prospective buyers to see its full beauty.
Staging the house, however, with some furniture and decorations helps 
prospective buyers imagine what the house might look like with their belongings. 
This is effectively what @product@'s 
[Resources Importer](https://dev.liferay.com/participate/liferaypedia/-/wiki/Main/Resources+Importer) 
does. The Resources Importer module is a tool that lets theme developers 
automatically import files and web content when a theme is deployed. 
Administrators can use the site or site template created by the Resources 
Importer to showcase the theme. This is a great way for theme developers to 
provide a sample context that optimizes the design of their theme. In fact, all 
standalone themes that are uploaded to Liferay Marketplace **must use** the 
Resources Importer. This ensures a uniform experience for Marketplace users: a 
user can download a theme from Marketplace, install it, go to Sites or Site 
Templates in the Control Panel and immediately see their new theme in action. 

This section of tutorials explains how to use the Resources Importer to import 
resources with your theme.
