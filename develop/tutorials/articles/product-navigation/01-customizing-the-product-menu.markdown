# Customizing the Product Menu

Liferay's Product Menu comes with three major panel categories, by default: the
Control Panel, User Settings, and Site Administration. Panel categories are the
term used to differentiate between sections of the menu. For instance, the
Control Panel is a single panel category, and when clicking on it, you're
presented with four other panel category children: *Users*, *Sites*, *Apps*, and
*Configuration*. It you click on one of these children panel categories, you're
presented with panel apps. This construction of the Product Menu was designed to
be intuitive and easy to use. In many scenarios, however, developers want to add
another panel category with custom panel apps, for example. Also, maybe you'd
like to change the order of your panel categories and/or apps.

Liferay provides an easy way to extend the Product Menu and customize it to
display what is most helpful in your particular situation.
