# Liferay MVC Portlet

Portlets are the most basic, most commonly used type of Liferay plugin you'll 
develop. Think of your Liferay portal as a pizza crust (sit down, you can go 
order a real pizza later). Liferay comes with some basic toppings that make for 
a pretty good pizza out of the box (i.e., the core portlets and built-in 
functionality). Of course, your boss might demand anchovies, and Liferay 
definitely doesn't come with anchovies. So what do you do? You take our tools, 
get some anchovies (your app's source code), and integrate them with the pizza 
(Liferay). Once you finish these tutorials you'll be such a portlet master that 
the end-user won't be able to tell the difference between your custom portlet 
and Liferay's core portlets.
