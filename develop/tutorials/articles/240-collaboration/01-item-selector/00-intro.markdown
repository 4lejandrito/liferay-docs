# Item Selector [](id=item-selector)

An *Item Selector* is a UI component that lets users select entities in a 
user-friendly manner. Many Liferay apps use Item Selectors to let users select 
items such as images, videos, audio files, documents, and pages. For example, 
the Documents and Media Library lets users select files.

The Item Selector API provides a framework for you to use, extend, and create 
Item Selectors in your own apps. The tutorials in this section show you how to 
use this framework. 

Here are some Item Selector use cases: 

1.  Letting your app's users select entities via an Item Selector. 

2.  Configuring an Item Selector to select your app's custom entity. 

3.  Customizing the selection experience by adding a new *selection view* for an 
    entity. 

Selection views are the framework's key components. They show entities of 
particular types from different sources. For example, an Item Selector 
configured to show images might show selection views from Documents and Media, a 
third-party image provider, or a drag-and-drop UI. You'll learn more about 
selection views as you work with them in these tutorials. 

Onwards!
