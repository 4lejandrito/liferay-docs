# Asset Framework 

Liferay's asset framework is a system that allows you to add common 
functionality to your application. For example, you might build an event 
management application that shows a list of upcoming events. It might be nice to 
be able to tag or categorize those events to provide users with metadata 
describing more about them. You might also want to let users comment on events. 

This common functionality is what Liferay's asset framework gives you. Using the
power of Liferay's built-in message boards, tags, and categories, Liferay lets
you infuse your application with these features in no time. 

The term *asset* is a generic term that refers to any type of content, including
text, an external file, a URL, an image, or a record in an online book library.
Consequently, when the term *asset* is used in these tutorials, some type of 
Liferay content is being referred to. For example, *asset* can be used to refer 
to documents, blog entries, bookmarks, wiki pages, or anything you create in 
your applications. 

Here are the features you can reuse thanks to the asset framework: 

-   Associate tags to custom content types. New tags are created automatically
    when the author assigns them to the content. 
-   Associate categories to custom content types. Authors are only allowed to
    select from predefined categories within several predefined vocabularies. 
-   Manage tags from the Control Panel, including merging tags. 
-   Manage categories from the Control Panel, including creating complex
    hierarchies. 
-   Associate comments with assets. 
-   Rate assets using a five star rating system. 
-   Assign social bookmarks to assets, including via tweet, Facebook like, or +1
    (Google Plus). 
-   Add custom fields to assets. 
-   Relate assets to one another. 
-   Flag asset content as inappropriate. 
-   Keep track of the number of visualizations of an asset. 
-   Integrate workflow with assets. 
-   Publish your content using the Asset Publisher portlet. Asset Publisher can
    publish dynamic asset lists or manually selected asset lists. It can also
    show an asset summary view with a link to the full view. This saves you
    time, since it likely won't be necessary to develop custom portlets for your
    custom content types. 

At this point you might be saying, "Liferay's asset framework sounds great, but
how do I leverage all these awesome functions?" Excellent question, young
padawan, and perfect timing! 

Before diving into the tutorials head first, the first two steps are described 
here: 

-   The first step is mandatory. You must let the framework know whenever one of
    your custom content entries is added, updated, or deleted. 
-   The second step enables the asset framework in the UI. You can use a set of
    taglibs to provide widgets that allow authors to enter comments, tags and
    categories and that show the entered tags and categories along with the
    content.
