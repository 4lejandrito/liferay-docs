# Developing Fragments

The goal of Fragments is to take a design or mockup and realize it on a web page
as accurately as possible. To do this, the developers are given a space where
they have a "blank slate" to create it. You have three tools at your disposal 
to accomplish this:

*  **HTML**: The markup of the fragment. Fragments use standard HTML with  
    special tags to add dynamic behavior.

*  **CSS**: CSS styles and positions the fragment's markup. 

*  **JavaScript**: JavaScript provides dynamic behavior to the fragment.

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is all completely standard, just like you'd use
anywhere else on the web, but there are a few Liferay specific options as well. 
Some text areas can be specified as editable, allowing that text to be modified
before it is published. Liferay portlets can also be embedded in 
Fragments as "widgets" which enable you to create more dynamic content and pages
with Fragments.
