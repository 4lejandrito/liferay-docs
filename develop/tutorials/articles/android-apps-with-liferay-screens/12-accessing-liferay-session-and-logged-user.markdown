# Accessing the Liferay Session and User Attributes [](id=accessing-the-liferay-session-and-user-attributes)

A session is a conversation state between the client and server. It typically 
consists of multiple requests and responses between the two. To facilitate this 
communication, the session must have the server IP address, and a user's login 
credentials. Liferay Screens uses a Liferay Session to access and query the 
JSON web services provided by Liferay Portal. When you log in using a Liferay 
Session, the portal returns the user's information (name, email, user ID, 
etc...). Screens stores this information and the active Liferay Session in 
Screens's `SessionContext` class. 

The `SessionContext` class is very powerful and lets you use Screens in many 
different scenarios. For example, you can use `SessionContext` to request 
information with the JSON WS API provided by Liferay. You can also use 
`SessionContext` to create anonymous sessions, or to log in a user without 
showing a Login Screenlet.

This tutorial explains some common `SessionContext` use cases, and and also 
describes the class's most important methods. 

## Creating a Session from an Existing Session [](id=creating-a-session-from-an-existing-session)

When working with Liferay Screens, you may wish to call the remote JSON web 
services provided by the Liferay Mobile SDK. Every operation with the Liferay 
Mobile SDK needs a Liferay Session to provide the server address, user 
credentials, and any other required parameters. Since the Login Screenlet 
creates a session when a user successfully logs in, you can retrieve this 
session with the `SessionContext` method `createSessionFromCurrentSession()`. 
You can then use that session to make the Mobile SDK service call. The following 
example shows this for calling the Mobile SDK's `BookmarksEntryService`: 

    Session sessionFromCurrentSession = SessionContext.createSessionFromCurrentSession();
    sessionFromCurrentSession.setCallback(callback);

    new BookmarksEntryService(sessionFromCurrentSession).methodCall()

If you need to check first to see if a user has logged in, you can use 
`SessionContext.isLoggedIn()`. 

Great! Now you know how to retrieve an existing session in your app. But what if 
you're not using the Login Screenlet? There won't be an existing session to 
retrieve. No sweat! You can still use `SessionContext` to create one manually. 
The next section shows you how to do this. 

## Creating a Session Manually [](id=creating-a-session-manually)

If you don't use the Login Screenlet, then `SessionContext` doesn't have a 
session for you to retrieve. In this case, you must create one manually. You can 
do this with the `SessionContext` method `createBasicSession`. The method takes 
a username and password as parameters, and creates a session with those 
credentials. If you also need to access a user's information, you must manually 
call the `User` JSON web service, or call `SessionContext.setLoggedUser()`. The 
following code creates a session with `createBasicSession` and then uses 
`setLoggedUser` to set the user in `SessionContext`:

    LiferayScreensContext.init(this);

    Session session = SessionContext.createBasicSession(USERNAME, PASSWORD);
    SessionContext.setLoggedUser(USER);

Note that you can acheive the same thing by calling the interactor directly: 

    LoginBasicInteractor loginBasicInteractor = new LoginBasicInteractor(0);
    loginBasicInteractor.onScreenletAttached(this);
    loginBasicInteractor.setLogin(USERNAME);
    loginBasicInteractor.setPassword(PASSWORD);
    loginBasicInteractor.login();

Super! Now you know how to create a session manually. The next section shows you 
how to implement auto-login, and save or restore a session.

## Implementing Auto-login and Saving or Restoring a Session [](id=implementing-auto-login-and-saving-or-restoring-a-session)

Although the Login Screenlet is awesome, your users may not want to enter their 
credentials every time they open your app. It's very common for apps to only 
require a single login. To implement this in your app, see 
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEZEahTzuck). 

In short, you need to pass a storage type to the Login Screenlet, and then use 
`SessionContext.isLoggedIn()` to check for a session. If a session doesn't 
exist, load the stored session from `CredentialsStorage` with 
`loadStoredCredentials(StorageType storageType)`. The following code shows a 
typical implementation of this:

    LiferayScreensContext.init(this); // If you haven't called a screenlet yet
    SessionContext.loadStoredCredentials(SHARED_PREFERENCES);

    if (SessionContext.hasSession()) {
	    // logged in
    } else {
	    // send user to login form
    }

Awesome! Now you know how to implement auto-login in your Liferay Screens apps. 
You've also seen how handy `SessionContext` can be. It can do even more! The 
next section lists some additional `SessionContext` methods. 

## Methods [](id=methods)

| Method | Return Type | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|-------------| 
| `logout()` | `void` | Clears the stored user attributes and session. |
| `isLoggedIn()` | `boolean` | returns `true` if there is a stored Liferay Session in `SessionContext`. |
| `createBasicSession(String username, String password)` | `Session` | Creates a Liferay Session using the default server and the supplied username and password. |
| `createSessionFromCurrentSession()` | `Session` | Creates a Liferay Session based on the stored credentials and server. |
| `getCurrentUser()` | `User` | Returns a `User` object containing the server attributes of the logged-in user. This includes the user's email, user ID, name, and portrait ID. |
| `storeCredentials(StorageType storageType)` | `void` | Stores the current session in the `StorageType` supplied as a parameter. |
| `removeStoredCredentials(StorageType storageType)` | `void` | Clears the `StorageType` of any user information and session. |
| `loadStoredCredentials(StorageType storageType)` | `void` | Loads the session and user information from the `StorageType` parameter, and uses it as the current session and user. |
