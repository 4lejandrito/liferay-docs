# Development Lifecycle for a Liferay Workspace

Liferay Workspaces provide an environment that supports all phases of a Liferay
module's development lifecycle:

- Creating modules
- Building modules
- Deploying modules
- Testing modules
- Releasing modules

Your workspace provides a flexible environment that can be used in many
different build tools and IDEs, such as Liferay @ide@. In this tutorial, you'll

addition, you'll be directed to other tutorials that go into further detail for
leveraging the workspace's particular lifecycle phase. Let's get started!
