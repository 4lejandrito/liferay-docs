# Creating a Liferay Workspace [](id=creating-a-liferay-workspace)

A *Liferay Workspace* is a generated environment that is built to hold and
manage your @product@ projects. This workspace is intended to aid in the
management of Liferay projects by providing various Gradle build scripts and
configured properties. This is the official way to create Liferay 7.0 modules
using Gradle. For those developers that still want to develop WAR-style plugins
using the Plugins SDK, this way is also supported using a Liferay Workspace.

Your workspace offers Gradle properties that you can modify to help manage the
generated folders. There are also some folders that aren't generated by
default, but can be manually created and set. This provides you the power to
customize your workspace's folder structure any way you'd like.

For this tutorial, you'll learn how to generate a Liferay Workspace using Blade
CLI. You can also create a Liferay Workspace using Liferay IDE, which runs on
Blade tools behind the scenes. Liferay IDE gives you a graphical interface
instead of the command prompt, which can streamline your workflow. Before
attempting to create a Liferay Workspace via Blade CLI in the command prompt,
make sure you've installed Blade, which is covered in the section
[Installing Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-blade-cli).

The instructions covered in this tutorial apply to both the commercial and open 
source versions of Liferay.

Buckle up! You're about to create your own Liferay 7.0 Workspace!



## Using Liferay IDE to Create Your Workspace [](id=using-liferay-ide-to-create-your-workspace)

Using Blade CLI is a great option for doing things fast and with little
overhead. There are, however, developers who prefer using an IDE with a nice
GUI. If you're one of those developers, Liferay provides the same workspace
functionality through Liferay IDE. If you're curious about the directory
structure and configuration files in a Liferay Workspace, visit the
[Using Blade to Create Your Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-a-liferay-workspace#using-blade-to-create-your-workspace)
section.

To create a Liferay Workspace in IDE, select *File* &rarr; *New* &rarr; *Liferay
Workspace Project*.

![Figure 1: By selecting *Liferay Workspace*, you begin the process of creating a new workspace for your Liferay projects.](../../../images/selecting-liferay-workspace.png)

A *New Liferay Workspace* popup window appears, presenting several configuration
options. Follow the instructions below to create your workspace.

1. Give your workspace a name. 

2. Choose the location where you'd like your workspace to reside. Checking the
   *Use default location* checkbox places your Liferay Workspace in the Eclipse
   workspace you're working in.

3. Check the *Download Liferay bundle* checkbox if you'd like to auto-generate a
   Liferay instance in your workspace. You'll be prompted to name the server, if
   selected. This Liferay bundle is generated the same way as described in the
   previous section.

    **Note:** If you'd like to configure a pre-existing Liferay bundle to your
    workspace, you can create a directory for the bundle in your workspace and
    configure it in the workspace's `gradle.properties` file by setting the
    `liferay.workspace.home.dir` property.

4. Check the *Add project to working set* checkbox if you'd like the workspace
to be a part of a larger working set you've already created in IDE. For more
information on working sets, visit
[Eclipse Help](http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fcworkset.htm).

5. Click *Finish* to create your Liferay Workspace.

![Figure 2: Liferay IDE provides an easy-to-follow menu to create your Liferay Workspace.](../../../images/new-workspace-menu.png)

A popup window appears prompting you to open the *Liferay Workspace*
perspective. Click *Yes*, and your perspective will switch to *Liferay
Workspace*.

The *Liferay Workspace* perspective is intended for Gradle development for
Liferay 7 modules. Since Liferay Workspaces are used for Gradle based
development and the *Liferay* workspace is intended for the Plugins SDK and Ant
based development, the two perspectives are independent of each other.

![Figure 3: The Liferay Workspace perspective is preferred for Liferay 7 and OSGi module development.](../../../images/liferay-workspace-perspective.png)

You'll find your new workspace in the Project Explorer and your Liferay server
(if you created it) in the Servers menu. It's important to note that an Eclipse
workspace can only have one Liferay Workspace project.

![Figure 4: An IDE workspace only supports one Liferay Workspace project. If you create another, you'll be given an error message.](../../../images/liferay-workspace-duplicate.png)

You can configure your workspace's module presentation by switching between the
default *Hierarchical* or *Flat* views. To do this, navigate to the Project
Explorer's *View Menu* (![View Menu](../../../images/icon-ide-view-menu.png))
and select *Projects Presentation* and then the presentation mode you'd like to
display. The Hierarchical view displays subfolders and subprojects under the
workspace project, whereas the Flat view displays the workspace's modules
separately from the workspace.

![Figure 5: The Hierarchical project presentation mode is set, by default.](../../../images/workspace-presentation.png)

If you've already created a Liferay Workspace and you'd like to import into your
existing IDE, you can do so by navigating to *File* &rarr; *Import* &rarr;
*Liferay* &rarr; *Liferay Workspace Project*. Then click *Next* and browse for
your worspace project. Once you've selected you workspace, click *Finish*.

![Figure 5: You can import an existing Liferay Workspace into your current IDE session.](../../../images/liferay-workspace-import.png)

Congratulations! You've learned how to create a Liferay Workspace using the
command line and Liferay IDE. Now that your workspace is created, you can
begin creating Liferay plugins.
