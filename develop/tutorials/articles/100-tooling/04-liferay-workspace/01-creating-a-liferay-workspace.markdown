# Creating a Liferay Workspace [](id=creating-a-liferay-workspace)

A *Liferay Workspace* is a generated environment that is built to hold and
manage your @product@ projects. This workspace is intended to aid in the
management of Liferay projects by providing various Gradle build scripts and
configured properties. This is the official way to create Liferay 7.0 modules
using Gradle. For those developers that still want to develop WAR-style plugins
using the Plugins SDK, this way is also supported using a Liferay Workspace.

Your workspace offers Gradle properties that you can modify to help manage the
generated folders. There are also some folders that aren't generated by
default, but can be manually created and set. This provides you the power to
customize your workspace's folder structure any way you'd like.
