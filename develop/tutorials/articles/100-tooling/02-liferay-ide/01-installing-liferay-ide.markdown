# Installing Liferay @ide@ [](id=installing-liferay-ide)

Liferay @ide@ is a plugin for Eclipse that brings many Liferay-specific features
to the table. You can install it into your existing Eclipse environment, or
Liferay provides a bundled version. In this tutorial, you'll learn the different
methods available for installing Dev Studio.

## Install the Dev Studio Bundle [](id=install-the-liferay-ide-bundle)

1.  Download and install [Java](http://java.oracle.com). Liferay runs on Java,
    so you'll need it to run everything else. Because you'll be developing apps
    for Liferay Portal in Dev Studio, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is
    required. It is an enhanced version of the Java Environment used for
    developing new Java technology. You can download the Java SE JDK from the
    Java
    [Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    page. 

2.  Download
    [Liferay @ide@](https://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-projects/liferay-ide).
    Installing it is easy: unzip it to a convenient location on your system. 

3. To run Dev Studio, execute the `eclipse` executable.

Congratulations! You've installed Liferay Dev Studio!
