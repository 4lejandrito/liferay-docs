# Creating an MVC Portlet [](id=creating-an-mvc-portlet)

You're convinced that Liferay's MVC Framework is right for you, and you want to
learn how to create an MVC portlet.

You'll need:

-  [A module that publishes a portlet Component with the necessary properties](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-a-module-with-an-mvc-portlet-component).
-  [Controller code to handle the request and response](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/writing-controller-code).
-  [JSPs to implement your view layer](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-the-view-layer).

Each part mentioned above has its own tutorial. They demonstrate creating a
small application using the Liferay MVC Framework. After completing them, go 
[beyond the basics](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/beyond-the-basics-for-portlets)
to explore MVC command classes and leverage additional features for your portlet
application.
