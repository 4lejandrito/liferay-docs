# Generating a JSF Application

Liferay offers you several options to generate a JSF application without forcing
you to manually create your own folder structure, descriptor files, etc. If
you'd like to examine the structure of a JSF application and create one from
scratch, see the
[Getting Started with JSF Applications](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/getting-started-with-jsf-applications)
tutorial.



You can even choose from several different types of component suites! The
easiest way to dive in to generating your JSP application is to first visit
[liferayfaces.org](http://liferayfaces.org/).
