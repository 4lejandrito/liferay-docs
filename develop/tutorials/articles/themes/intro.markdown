# Themes and Layout Templates [](id=themes-and-layout-templates)

Do you want to transform the look and feel of your Liferay Portal? Create your
own Liferay Theme! Themes are hot deployable plugins unique to a site served by
the portal. With themes, you can alter the user interface so completely that
it's difficult or impossible to tell that the site is running on Liferay. 

Are there times when you find yourself limited by Liferay's page layout options? 
Maybe your Feng Shui (pronounced *fung SHWAY*) senses are picking up on some 
negative energy? Or perhaps you find yourself adding the same portlets over and 
over again onto the same types of pages? Don't despair! Break the monotony by 
creating your own custom layout templates. Layout template plugins let you 
design layouts that flow nicely, embed commonly used portlets, and apply CSS, 
Velocity, and HTML to make your pages visually pop. 

You'll learn how to develop themes and layout templates in this section of
tutorials.
