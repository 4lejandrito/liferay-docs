# Themes and Layout Templates [](id=themes-and-layout-templates-lp-6-2-develop-tutorial)

Do you want to transform the look and feel of your Liferay Portal? Create your
own Liferay Theme! Themes are hot deployable plugins unique to a site. With
themes, you can alter the user interface so completely that it's difficult or
impossible to tell that the site is running on Liferay. In this section of
tutorials, you'll learn how to develop themes.

In addition to transforming your site's look and feel, are there times when you
find yourself limited by Liferay's page layout options? Maybe your Feng Shui
(pronounced *fung SHWAY*) senses are picking up on some negative energy? Or
perhaps you find yourself adding the same portlets over and over again onto the
same types of pages? Don't despair! Break the monotony by creating your own
custom layout templates. Layout template plugins let you design layouts that
flow nicely, embed commonly used portlets, and apply CSS, FreeMarker, Velocity,
and HTML to make your pages visually pop. You'll learn how to develop layout
templates in these tutorials too.
