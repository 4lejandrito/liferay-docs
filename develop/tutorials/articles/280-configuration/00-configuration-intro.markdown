# Configuration [](id=configuration)

Many applications allow users to set preferences. Configuration use cases range
from simple ones like setting a location for a weather display, to more complex
cases like settings for a mail or a time sheet application. 

The Portlet standard's portlet preferences API can be used for portlet
configuration, but it's limited and isn't used much. Application developers have
instead tended to create ad hoc configuration methods on an as-needed basis. 

The ad hoc approach to configuration is no longer necessary: there's a
configuration API that's easy to use and full-featured. It's used throughout
@product@'s applications. We like it, and we think you'll like it too. 

The following tutorials show you how to use it.
