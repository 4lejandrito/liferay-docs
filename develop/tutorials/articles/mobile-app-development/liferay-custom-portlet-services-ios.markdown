# Making Liferay and Custom Portlet Services Available in Your iOS App 

You've just created a custom iOS app and now want your app to access Liferay
services. How do you access Liferay services from an iOS mobile app? Use
Liferay's iOS SDK, of course. If you'd like to invoke remote web services,
you'll need to generate the client libraries. You can learn more about the SDK
builder and how to generate client libraries by reading the Custom Portlet
[Building an SDK for Custom Portlet Services](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/build-sdk-for-custom-portlet-services-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)
section. 

Let's get started by downloading the iOS SDK and configuring it in your iOS
environment! 

## Setting Up the iOS SDK 

To install the iOS SDK to your machine, you'll need to download the latest
version of `liferay-ios-sdk.zip`. You can download this file from the [Liferay
Mobile
SDK](https://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-mobile-sdk)
project page. These installation instructions assume you're using the XCode
developer tool provided by Apple, which can be downloaded from the [Mac App
Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12).

After you've downloaded the Zip file, unzip it into your XCode project. Within
XCode, right-click on your project and click *Add Files to <PROJECT_NAME>*.
Then, add both `core` and `v62` folders. The `v62` folder name can change for
each Liferay version. In this example, the Mobile SDK is built for Liferay 6.2.

Awesome! Let's learn how to configure the SDK next.
