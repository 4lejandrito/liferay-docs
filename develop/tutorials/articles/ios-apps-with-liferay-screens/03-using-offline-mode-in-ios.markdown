# Using Offline Mode in iOS

Offline mode in Liferay Screens lets your apps function when connectivity is 
unavailable or intermittent. Even though the steady march of technology makes 
connections more stable and prevalent, there are still plenty of places the 
internet has trouble reaching. Areas with complex terrain, including cities with 
large buildings, often lack stable connections. Remote areas typically don't 
have a connection at all. Using Screens's offline mode in your apps gives your 
users flexibility in these situations. 

This tutorial shows you how to use offline mode in Screenlets. For an 
explanation of how offline mode works, see the tutorial 
[Architecture of Offline Mode in Liferay Screens](). 
Offline mode's architecture is the same on iOS and Android, although its use on 
these platforms differs.
