# Displaying Messages and Errors

When users interact with your application, they perform tasks defined by the
application, like saving or editing things. The Guestbook application is no
different. It's good if your application can provide feedback on these
operations so users know whatever option they clicked either worked successfully
or resulted in an error. Up to now, you've been placing this information in logs
that only administrators can access. Wouldn't it be better to surface these
messages to the users?

That's exactly what you'll do next, in three steps: 

1.  Create language keys for your messages

2.  Add the error messages in your action methods

3.  Report those error messages in your JSPs
