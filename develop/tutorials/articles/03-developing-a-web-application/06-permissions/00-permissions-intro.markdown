# Permissions

You now have an application that uses the database for data storage. This is a
great foundation upon which to build. What comes next? What if users want a
Guestbook that's limited only to certain trusted people? To do that, you have to
implement permissions. 

Thankfully with @product@, you don't have to do this yourself: the framework
provides a robust and well-tested permissions system that you can implement
quickly.
