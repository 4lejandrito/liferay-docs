#Why Liferay's Platform is Good for Developers

##Modularity
Modules are the best.

Liferay does modules.

Don't you wish you had modules?

##So Many Features
Are you familiar with features? Liferay has many.

WCM, Collaboration, Workflow, Staging, I can't even name them all.

Integrate your custom applications with all these cool features.

##Service Builder
It builds services with the build service command, if you command it to.

It generates code so your fingers don't have to.

Good stuff.
