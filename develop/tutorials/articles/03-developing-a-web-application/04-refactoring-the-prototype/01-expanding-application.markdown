# Setting the Display Category for the Guestbook Portlet [](id=setting-the-display-category-for-the-guestbook-portlet)

The Guestbook portlet doesn't have a display category specified yet. Apps
without a display category will be in an "Undefined" category. This isn't
an ideal user experience if you want to add the application to a page. 

To fix this, you'll specify the display category for the Guestbook portlet, rearrange the folder structure, and while you're at it, update the metadata so
that things like the portlet name display in a more user friendly fashion.
