# Asset Enabling Custom Entities [](id=asset-enabling-custom-entities)

Liferay's asset framework transforms entities into a common format that can be
published anywhere in your site. Web content articles, blog posts, wiki
articles, and documents are some asset-enabled entities that come
out-of-the-box. You can asset-enable your own applications, so you can take
advantage of @product@'s functionality for publishing your application's data
across your site in the form of asset publisher entries, notifications, social
activities, and more. 

@product@'s asset framework includes the following features:

- Tags and categories
- Comments and ratings
- Related assets (a.k.a. asset links)
- Faceted search
- Integration with @product@'s Asset Publisher portlet
- Integration with @product@'s Search portlet
- Integration with @product@'s Tags Navigation portlet, Tag Cloud portlet, and
  Categories Navigation portlets

In this Learning Path, you'll asset-enable the guestbook and guestbook entry
entities. You'll implement tags, categories, and related assets for guestbooks
and guestbook entries. You'll implement comments and ratings in guestbook
entries. You'll also learn how asset-enabled guestbooks and guestbook entries
integrate with @product@ core portlets including the Asset Publisher, Tags
Navigation, Tag Cloud, and Categories Navigation portlets.
