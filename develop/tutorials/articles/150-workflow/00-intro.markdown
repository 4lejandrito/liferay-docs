# Workflow

Use the workflow framework to run assets through a business process to suit your
organization's needs. Workflow processes are designed from scratch using XML or
via the handy [Kaleo Designer](LINK) tool that comes with DE subscriptions.

makes designing workflows easy and intuitive.](../../images/legal-marketing-def.png)

This set of tutorials delves into the following workflow framework topics:

- Creating Workflow Definitions (using XML)
- Enabling Assets for Workflow
- Creating Workflow Engine Adapters

To manage workflow definitions and define their assignment schemes, check out
the [workflow section of the administrator documentation](LINK)
