# Workflow

*[This is an introductory story, feel free to skip the italics to get to the details]*

*Rupert fit in well with the rest of ThisCorp's employees. He dressed in
business casual attire (except on Blue Jeans day, which happened once per
quarter) arrived at work on time, and liked to accompany his fellow employees
to the tavern for drinks on Friday at 5:30 p.m.. Rupert
reeeeaaaaallllyyy liked Fridays. One slow week in January, Rupert rounded up a
group of fellow-minded colleagues to join him for drinks on Thursday. He just
couldn't wait until Friday this week.  Unfortunately, Rupert's enthusiasm led
him to drink far too many libations, and his discretion was still compromised
when he arrived at work on Friday (on time, wearing fresh khakis and a brand
new polo shirt). He went about his business in a bit of a stupor. After lunch
time he felt quite recovered and was surprised when his supervisor, Rufelia,
stormed into his office.*

*"Rupert, we need to talk", Rufelia said in a calm voice that belied her true mood.*

*"Sure, Rufelia. Did you see my blog post on our plans to merge with OtherCorp?"*

*"Yes, Rupert. That's why I'm here."*

*At this point Rupert was very concerned. He couldn't remember the details of
his blog post, so he simplay said, "Okay".*

*Rufelia handed him a printed version of the thiscorp.com Blog page, with his blog post featured at the top. "I printed us both a copy of your post so we can look at it together. I printed our Guide to BLogging memo as well. Did you get that memo?"*

*"Yeah, I have the memo right here", Rupert replied, as he gently patted a stack of papers on his desk.*

*"Okay, well, here's another one", Rufelia said, and she slid the familiar
pink folder onto his desk. "Let's look at your post now."*

*Rupert took the printout and stared at it in horror, as he thought about the
state of his resume.*
