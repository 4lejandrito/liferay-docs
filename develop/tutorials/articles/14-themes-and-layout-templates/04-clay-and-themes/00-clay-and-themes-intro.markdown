# Clay CSS and Themes [](id=clay-css-and-themes)

@product@ has its own design language called 
[Lexicon](https://lexicondesign.io/) 
that provides a common framework for building consistent UIs across @product@.
[Clay](https://claycss.com/) 
is the web implementation of Lexicon. Clay CSS--a part of this web 
implementation--is an extension of Bootstrap's CSS Framework. Bootstrap is by 
far the most popular CSS framework on the web. Also, it's open source, so anyone 
can use it. Built with Sass, Clay CSS fills the front-end gaps between Bootstrap 
and the specific needs of @product@.

These tutorials look briefly at Clay CSS and show you how to use it in your 
@product@ themes.
