# Clay CSS and Themes [](id=clay-css-and-themes)

Clay CSS is an extension of Bootstrap's CSS Framework. Bootstrap is by far 
the most popular CSS framework on the web. Also, it's open source, so anyone can 
use it. Built with Sass, Clay CSS fills the front-end gaps between Bootstrap 
and the specific needs of @product@.

These tutorials look briefly at Clay CSS and show you how to use it in your 
@product@ themes.
