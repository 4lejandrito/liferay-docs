# Portlets and Themes [](id=portlets-and-themes-intro)

@product@ provides you with a default theme that sets the basic look and feel
for all your portlets, and, through Portlet Decorators, gives you a way to
fine-tune the look of individual portlets with the click of a mouse. But you
aren't limited to defaults. The following sections explain how to modify themes
to create custom templates for your portlets, as well as how to create your own
decorators to customize the look of your portlets individually. Additionally,
you'll learn how to embed portlets in your themes, a function that allows you to
choose portlets to deploy automatically on any page were a given theme is used.
