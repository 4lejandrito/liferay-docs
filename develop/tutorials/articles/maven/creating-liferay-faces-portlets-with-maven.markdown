# Developing Liferay Faces Portlets with Maven

If you're unfamiliar with the Liferay Faces project, it's important to know that
Liferay Faces is an umbrella project that provides support for the JavaServer
Faces (JSF) standard within Liferay Portal. Thus, Liferay Faces portlets and JSF
portlets are very closely related with each other. Visit the [JSF-related
learning
path](/develop/learning-paths/-/knowledge_base/writing-your-first-jsf-application)
for further details on JSF portlets and the Liferay Faces project. 

This tutorial explains how to create Liferay Faces portlets using Maven and the
anatomy of a JSF portlet. 

<!-- Make sure the JSF learning path link above is updated once it has been
created. -Cody -->

Liferay Faces portlets can be built as a number of different portlets related to
the JSF technology. When developing Liferay Faces portlets with Maven, you have
a few different JSF frameworks you can choose to build your portlet with, which
include: [*RichFaces*](http://richfaces.jboss.org/),
[*PrimeFaces*](http://primefaces.org/), [*Liferay Faces
Alloy*](https://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/alloy),
[*JSF standard*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Faces), and
[*ICEfaces*](http://www.icesoft.org/java/projects/ICEfaces/overview.jsf)
portlets. 

You'll begin creating a Liferay Faces portlet plugin next.
