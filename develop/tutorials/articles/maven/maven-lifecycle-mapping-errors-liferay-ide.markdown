# Resolving Maven Lifecycle Mapping Errors in Imported Projects

The `m2e-liferay` plugin for Liferay IDE automatically contributes the lifecycle 
mappings required for using Maven with your Liferay projects. Installation 
instructions and a more thorough discussion of the `m2e-liferay` plugin are 
contained in the tutorial [Using Maven from Liferay IDE](/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/using-maven-from-liferay-ide). 
As you might guess, lifecycle mapping errors occur if you try to import a Maven 
project and don't have the `m2e-liferay` plugin installed. Fortunately, Liferay 
IDE lets you import the Maven project *and* install the `m2e-liferay` plugin in 
a single step. This tutorial walks you through the process of importing a Maven 
project in Liferay IDE and simultaneously installing the `m2e-liferay` plugin.
