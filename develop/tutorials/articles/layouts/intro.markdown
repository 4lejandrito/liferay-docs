# Layouts [](id=layouts-lp-6-2-develop-tutorial)

Are there times when you find yourself limited by Liferay's page layout options? 
Maybe your Feng Shui (pronounced *fung SHWAY*) senses are picking up on some 
negative energy? Or perhaps you find yourself adding the same portlets over and 
over again onto the same types of pages? Don't despair! Break the monotony by 
creating your own custom layout templates. Layout template plugins let you 
design layouts that flow nicely, embed commonly used portlets, and apply CSS, 
Velocity, and HTML to make your pages visually pop.
