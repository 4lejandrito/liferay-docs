# Troubleshooting JSF Portlet Deployment Errors

Many of us have experienced it, you go to deploy a new application into your
portal instance and see the dreaded deployment error messages. What do you do?
Is the error message helpful? How can I find the solution?

If you're experiencing deployment problems with deploying a JSF portlet on
Liferay, there's a simple process you can follow to solve your deployment
issues. Instead of trying to figure out what's wrong with your code, it's
sometimes easier to compare your portlet to a working example. The
strategy/tutorial below creates a working example to compare your project to.
This strategy is recommended by the Liferay Faces team.
