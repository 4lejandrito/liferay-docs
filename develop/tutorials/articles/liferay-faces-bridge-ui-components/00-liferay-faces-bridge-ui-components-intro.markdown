# Liferay Faces Bridge UI Components [](id=liferay-faces-bridge-ui-components)

Although the JSR 329 standard does not define any JSF components that bridge
implementations are required to provide, Liferay Faces Bridge comes with a
handful of components that are helpful to use in JSF portlets. 

Because Liferay Faces has several [active versions](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/liferay-faces-version-scheme-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)
(targeting different versions of JSF, Liferay Portal, etc.), there are several
versions of the project View Declaration Language (VDL) documentation for these
tags. The VDL documentation can be found at the following addresses: 

- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 2.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/2.1/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.0-legacy can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0-legacy/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.0 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.1/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.2 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.2/vdldoc/>.

and `portlet` namespaces for the Bridge and Portlet 2.0 tags, respectively. In
