# Migrating Facelet Tag Library Namespaces [](id=migrate-facelet-tag-library-namespaces-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The projects at portletfaces.org provided several UIComponents and Composite
Components for use within Facelet views. The tag library documentation for these
components has been migrated to VDL documentation for each version of the
Liferay Faces Bridge: 

- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 2.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/2.1/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 3.0-legacy can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0-legacy/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 3.0 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 3.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.1/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.2 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.2/vdldoc/>.

<!-- Re-add upon release. - Jim
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 4.1 can be found at <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/4.1/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 4.2 can be found at <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/4.2/vdldoc/>.
-->

Each link for the VDL documentation contains information about all the `aui`,
`aui-cc`, `bridge`, `liferay-ui`, `liferay-util`, and `liferay-security` tags
for that version of the Liferay Faces Bridge, so each VDL documentation link
basically holds the entirety of the PortletFaces tag library documentation (with
the exception of certain tags which are excluded from certain versions of the
Lfieray Faces Bridge).
