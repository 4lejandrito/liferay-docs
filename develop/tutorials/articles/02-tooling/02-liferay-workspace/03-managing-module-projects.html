<h1>Managing Module Projects</h1><p>In Liferay Workspaces, Gradle is the build tool used to compile and publish Liferay modules. Before you can begin managing your Liferay module projects from a Liferay Workspace, you&rsquo;ll need to create a Liferay Workspace, which is covered in the <a href="/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-a-liferay-workspace">Creating a Liferay Workspace</a> tutorial. Once you&rsquo;ve created your Liferay Workspace, you can begin using it to manage Gradle-based OSGi modules for @product@.</p><p>In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how to deploy modules to a Liferay server using Liferay Workspace. Also, you&rsquo;ll explore several other ways to install, start, stop, inspect, and modify a Liferay server. You&rsquo;ll examine two tools for working with a workspace: Blade CLI and Liferay IDE. Time to get started!</p><a id="using-blade-cli"></a><h2>Using Blade CLI</h2><p>Deploying your projects to @product@ is one of the more popular Blade CLI commands that works with your Liferay server. Because Blade CLI is configured to deploy modules to a running Liferay instance, the deployment mechanism works similarly in a workspace compared to when it&rsquo;s run standalone. You can learn more about deploying a module using Blade CLI in the <a href="/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/deploying-to-liferay">Deploying to Liferay</a> tutorial.</p><p>Besides the <code>blade deploy</code> command, there are several other miscellaneous commands that can also be useful during development. Make sure you&rsquo;re in a Liferay Workspace and have a bundle installed and configured in the workspace before testing the Blade CLI commands on your own. To learn more about installing a Liferay server in a Liferay Workspace, see the <a href="/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-a-liferay-workspace#running-a-liferay-instance-from-your-workspace">Running a Liferay Instance From Your Workspace</a> section.</p><p>The first thing that comes to mind when interacting with a server is simply turning it on/off. You can use the <code>server</code> sub-command to accomplish this. To turn on a Liferay server, you can run</p>
<pre><code>blade server start -b
</code></pre><p>Likewise, to turn off a server, run</p>
<pre><code>blade server stop
</code></pre><p>Once you&rsquo;ve started your bundle, you can examine your server&rsquo;s OSGi container by using the <code>sh</code> command, which provides access to your server using the Felix Gogo shell. For example, to check if you successfully deployed your application from the previous section, you could run:</p>
<pre><code>blade sh lb
</code></pre><p>Your output lists a long list of modules that are active/installed in your server&rsquo;s OSGi container.</p><p><img src="../../../../images/blade-sh.png" alt="Figure 1" /><p class="caption">Figure 1: Blade CLI accesses the Gogo shell script to run the <code>lb</code> command.</p><p>You can run any Gogo command using <code>blade sh</code>. See the <a href="/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-the-felix-gogo-shell">Using the Felix Gogo Shell</a> section for more information on this tool.</p><p>You can access a workspace&rsquo;s Gradle wrapper automatically by using the <code>gw</code> command. Since the workspace&rsquo;s Gradle wrapper resides in its root folder, it can sometimes be a hassle running it for a deeply nested module (e.g., <code>../../../../gradlew compileJava</code>). Running Gradle wrapper from Blade CLI automatically detects the Gradle wrapper and can run it anywhere. For instance, if you&rsquo;re in a deeply nested directory trying to compile a module, you can simply run:</p>
<pre><code>blade gw compileJava
</code></pre><p>This example runs the <code>compileJava</code> command using the workspace&rsquo;s include wrapper. Any Gradle command can be used with the <code>gw</code> Blade CLI command.</p><p>Awesome! You successfully deployed a project from Blade CLI and learned how to conveniently interact with @product@ using Blade CLI. Next, you&rsquo;ll learn more about using a workspace from Liferay IDE.</p><a id="using-liferay-ide"></a><h2>Using Liferay IDE</h2><p>Liferay IDE offers the functionality provided by Blade CLI in a GUI. Before you begin learning about managing your modules from Liferay IDE, you should make sure a Liferay server is configured in your Eclipse workspace. Although a server is not required to manage your module projects, it&rsquo;s helpful for testing once you&rsquo;ve finished developing them. You can learn how to create a Liferay bundle and link it to your workspace in the <a href="/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-a-liferay-workspace#using-liferay-ide-to-create-your-workspace">Using Liferay IDE to Create Your Workspace</a> section.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve created modules in your workspace and have linked the workspace to a Liferay bundle, you can deploy them using Liferay IDE. First, make sure your Liferay server is started by clicking the <em>Start Server</em> button (<img src="../../../images/icon-start-server.png"  alt="Start Server"/>). Then navigate to your module project from the Project Explorer and drag-and-drop the project onto the configured Liferay bundle in the <em>Servers</em> menu. If at any time you&rsquo;d like to stop your workspace&rsquo;s Liferay server, click the <em>Stop Server</em> button (<img src="../../../images/icon-stop-server.png"  alt="Stop Server"/>). Awesome! You&rsquo;ve deployed a module to your running Liferay instance!</p><p>For the deployed module project, you can check if it has been deployed successfully by using <a href="/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-the-felix-gogo-shell">Gogo Shell</a>. Right-click the started portal in server view and select <em>Open Gogo Shell</em>.</p><p><img src="../../../images/open-gogo-shell.png" alt="Figure 2" /><p class="caption">Figure 2: Select <em>Open Gogo Shell</em> to open a terminal window in IDE using Gogo Shell.</p><p>A Gogo Shell terminal displays, allowing you to enter Gogo command to inspect your Liferay instance and the modules deployed to it. Enter the <code>lb</code> command to view a list of deployed modules. If the project status is active, then it already deployed successfully.</p><p><img src="../../../images/gogo-deploy-successful.png" alt="Figure 3" /><p class="caption">Figure 3: You can check to see if your module deployed successfully to Liferay using the Gogo Shell.</p><p>Since the Liferay Workspace perspective in IDE is Gradle-based, you have some additional Gradle features you can take advantage of. The <em>Gradle Tasks</em> toolbar presents Gradle commands for your workspace that you can execute with a click of the mouse.</p><p><img src="../../../images/gradle-task-toolbar.png" alt="Figure 4" /><p class="caption">Figure 4: The Gradle Task toolbar offers Gradle tasks and their descriptions, which can be executed by double-clicking them.</p><p>You can also access various Gradle build operations intended for Liferay module projects. Right-click your module project and select <em>Liferay</em> &rarr; <em>Gradle</em> and then the build command you&rsquo;d like to execute.</p><p><img src="../../../images/gradle-build-operations.png" alt="Figure 4" /><p class="caption">Figure 4: The Gradle Task toolbar offers Gradle tasks and their descriptions, which can be executed by double-clicking them.</p><p>When updating Gradle files in your workspace (e.g., <code>build.gradle</code>), it&rsquo;s important to keep your project up-to-date in the IDE. Therefore, when changing Gradle configurations or properties, always right-click your module project and select <em>Gradle</em> &rarr; <em>Refresh Gradle Project</em>.</p><p>Excellent! You&rsquo;ve learned how to manage your Gradle-based Liferay Workspace using Liferay IDE.</p>
