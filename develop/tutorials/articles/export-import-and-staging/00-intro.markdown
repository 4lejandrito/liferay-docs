# Export/Import and Staging

Liferay's Export/Import and Staging features give users the power to plan
page publication and manage content. The Export/Import feature lets users export
content as a LAR file from Portal and import external content into Portal.
Staging lets site administrators modify their sites behind the scenes and
publish all their updates in one fell swoop. To learn more about the
[Export/Import](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/export-import) and
[Staging](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/staging-page-publication)
features, visit their respective user documentation articles.

Liferay also provides an API that allows developers to write custom code,
extending Liferay's default functionality. In this section of tutorials, you'll
learn about the various extension points and other options that are provided to
you for export/import and staging.
