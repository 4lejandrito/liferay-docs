# Liferay IDE

Even if you're a grizzled veteran Java developer, if you're going to be doing a
lot of development for your Liferay Portal instance, consider using Liferay IDE.
When Liferay IDE is paired with the Plugins SDK or Maven and a Liferay runtime
environment, you have a one stop development environment where you can develop
your Liferay plugins, build them, and deploy them to your Liferay instance.

Liferay IDE is an extension for Eclipse IDE and supports development of plugin
projects for the Liferay Portal platform. You can install Liferay IDE as a set
of Eclipse plugins from an update site. The latest version of Liferay IDE
supports development of portlets, hooks, layout templates, themes, and Ext
plugins. To use Liferay IDE, you need the Eclipse Java EE developer package
using Indigo or a later version. 

In this section we'll show you how to install Liferay IDE, set up projects for
your applications, and deploy them to your portal. We'll get you started with
the basics of developing your Liferay application in Liferay IDE. The guide has
other chapters geared to each specific plugin type (e.g., the *portlets* chapter
covers portlet development, the *hooks* chapter covers hook development, etc.).
But, as we create a Liferay portlet project in this chapter, you'll get the gist
of how Liferay IDE helps you create all types of plugins easily. 

We'll also introduce you to Liferay's Service Builder. It helps you leverage
Hibernate's Object-Relational Mapping capabilities and gives you the capability
to automatically generate code to access Liferay object data. We'll point out
the various editor modes Liferay IDE provides for creating your data entities,
relating them, and building services around them.
