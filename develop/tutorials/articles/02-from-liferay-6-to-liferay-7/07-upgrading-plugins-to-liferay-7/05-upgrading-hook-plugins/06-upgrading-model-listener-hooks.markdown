# Upgrading Model Listener Hooks [](id=upgrading-model-listener-hooks)

Developers have been creating model listeners for several Liferay Portal versions. Upgrading Model Listener Hooks from previous portal versions has never been easier. 

1.  Adapt your plugin to @product-ver@'s API using @liferay-ide@'s Code
    Upgrade Tool.

2.  Deploy the plugin.


Your hook plugin is "all ears", listening for changes to the model so it can
take action.
