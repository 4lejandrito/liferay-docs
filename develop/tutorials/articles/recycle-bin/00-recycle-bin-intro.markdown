# Recycle Bin [](id=recycle-bin)

How many times have you deleted something, only to realize it was a mistake and 
you need to restore it? Does the app you're working on have a delete function? 
If so, you can add the ability to move items into a recycle bin, instead of 
deleting them immediately. Have you been looking for an easy way to implement 
this capability in your app? Fortunately, you can, with Liferay's Recycle Bin.

The Recycle Bin tutorials use code from Liferay's [Jukebox Portlet](https://github.com/liferay-labs/jukebox-portlet)
to demonstrate implementing the Recycle Bin in an app. The Jukebox Portlet
plugin encompasses three portlets: Songs, Albums, and Artists. These portlets
work together letting the Jukebox user upload songs to the portal. You can
categorize the songs by album and artist. You can move the Jukebox portlet's
songs and albums to and from the Recycle Bin. 

Following the Jukebox Portlet's example in these tutorials, you can implement
recycling capabilities in your application.
