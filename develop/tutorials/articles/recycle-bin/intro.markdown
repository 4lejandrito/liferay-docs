# Using the Recycle Bin in Your Apps

How many times have you deleted something, only to realize it was a mistake and 
you need to restore it? Does the app you're working on have a delete function? 
If so, you can add the ability to move items into a recycle bin instead of 
deleting them immediately. Have you been looking for an easy way to implement 
this capability in your app? Fortunately, you can, with the help of Liferay's 
Recycle Bin.
