# Creating Get Entries Screenlet

In this Learning Path's previous section, you created the Get Guestbooks 
Screenlet. You still need a way, however, to retrieve and display each 
guestbook's entries. You'll do this by creating another Screenlet: the Get 
Entries Screenlet. This section in the Learning Path walks you through the steps 
required to create this Screenlet. 

Because you use a consistent development model to create Screenlets, similar 
Screenlets have similar code. As with guestbooks, it makes sense to display 
entries in a list using Android's 
[`ListView`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html). 
This means you can reuse most of Get Guestbook Screenlet's code in Get Entries 
Screenlet. You'll therefore create Get Entries Screenlet using the same sequence 
of steps you used to create Get Guestbooks Screenlet. Although this Learning 
Path section presents complete code snippets, it only discusses the code unique 
to Get Entries Screenlet. You can refer back to the previous section for 
detailed explanations of the code shared with Get Guestbooks Screenlet.
