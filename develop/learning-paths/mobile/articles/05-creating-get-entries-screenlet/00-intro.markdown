# Creating Get Entries Screenlet

In this Learning Path's previous section, you created the Get Guestbooks 
Screenlet. You still need a way, however, to retrieve and display each 
guestbook's entries. You'll do this by creating and using another Screenlet: the 
Get Entries Screenlet. This section in the Learning Path walks you through the 
steps required to create this Screenlet. 

Because the Screenlet development model offers a consistent, repeatable way to 
develop app components, similar Screenlets have similar code. As with 
guestbooks, it makes sense to display entries in a list using Android's 
[`ListView`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html). 
This means you can reuse most of Get Guestbook Screenlet's code in Get Entries 
Screenlet. As a result, you'll create Get Entries Screenlet using the same 
sequence of steps you used to create Get Guestbooks Screenlet. Although this 
learning path section presents complete code snippets, it only discusses the 
code unique to Get Entries Screenlet. You can refer back to the previous section 
for detailed explanations of the remaining code.
