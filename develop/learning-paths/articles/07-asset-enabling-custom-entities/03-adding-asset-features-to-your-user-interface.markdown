# Adding Asset Features to Your User Interface

Now that your guestbook and guestbook entry entities have been asset-enabled,
you're ready to use Liferay's asset functionality in your application. You'll
start by implementing comments, ratings, tags, categories, and related assets
for guestbooks. Then you'll circle back and implement this same functionality
for guestbook entries. All of the back-end support for these features is
provided by Liferay. Your only task is to update your applications' user
interfaces to use these features.
