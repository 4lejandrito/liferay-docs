# Adding Asset Features to Your User Interface

Now that your guestbook and guestbook entry entities have been asset-enabled,
you're ready to use Liferay's asset functionality in your application. You'll
start by implementing comments, ratings, tags, categories, and related assets
for guestbooks. Then you'll circle back and implement this same functionality
for guestbook entries. All of the back-end support for these features is
provided by Liferay. Your only task is to update your applications' user
interfaces to use these features.

## Creating JSPs for Displaying Custom Assets in the Asset Publisher

Before you proceed, you need to tie up one loose end from the previous section.
Remember that you implemented `render` methods in your `GuestbookAssetRenderer`
and `EntryAssetRenderer` classes. These classes return strings containing the
paths to the JSPs that the Asset Publisher should use for displaying the full
content of the assets. The `render` method of `GuestbookAssetRenderer` returns
`"/html/guestbookadmin/full_content.jsp"` and the `render` method of
`EntryAssetRenderer` returns `"/html/guestbook/full_content.jsp"`. It's time to
create these JSPs.

In your guestbook-portlet project, create a new file called `full_content.jsp`
in the `docroot/html/guestbookadmin` folder. This JSP will display the full
content of a guestbook asset. Add the following contents to this file:

    <%@include file="/html/init.jsp"%>

    <%
    Guestbook guestbook = (Guestbook)request.getAttribute("gb_guestbook");

    guestbook = guestbook.toEscapedModel();
    %>

    <dl>
            <dt>Name</dt>
            <dd><%= guestbook.getName() %></dd>
    </dl>

In this simple JSP, you just grab the guestbook object which was added as a
request attribute. Then you display the guestbook name. The `render` method of
`GuestbookAssetRenderer` added the `gb_guestbook` request attribute with the
following line:

    renderRequest.setAttribute("gb_guestbook", _guestbook);

The guestbook's `toEscapedModel` method belong to the `GuestbookModelImpl` class
which was generated by Service Builder. This method returns a "safe" guestbook
object, i.e. a guestbook model for which each field has been HTML-escaped.
Calling `guestbook = guestbook.toEscapedModel();` before displaying the
guestbook name ensures that your JSP won't display a maliciously designed
guestbook name.

Next, you need to create a `full_content.jsp` for for displaying the full
content of a guestbook entry asset. Create a new file called `full_content.jsp`
in the `docroot/html/guestbook` folder. Add the following contents to this file:

    <%@include file="/html/init.jsp"%>

    <%
    Entry entry = (Entry)request.getAttribute("gb_entry");

    entry = entry.toEscapedModel();
    %>

    <dl>
            <dt>Guestbook</dt>
            <dd><%= GuestbookLocalServiceUtil.getGuestbook(entry.getGuestbookId()).getName() %></dd>
            <dt>Name</dt>
            <dd><%= entry.getName() %></dd>
            <dt>Message</dt>
            <dd><%= entry.getMessage() %></dd>
    </dl>

This JSP is almost as simple as the one for guestbooks. The only difference is
that you're displaying three fields of the guestbook entry entity as opposed to
one field of the guestbook entity.

Test out your new JSPs by clicking on one of the *Read More* links for a
guestbook or guestbook entry that's being displayed by the Asset Publisher
portlet. Alternatively, you can click on the title of the guestbook or guestbook
entry asset. Your `full_content.jsp` should be rendered by the Asset Publisher
portlet:

![Figure x: When you click on the *Read More* link for a guestbook or guestbook entry that's displayed by the Asset Publisher, your `full_content.jsp` should be displayed.](../../images/asset-publisher-full-content.png)

By default, when displaying the full view of an asset, the Asset Publisher
displays additional links for Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus. These links
allow you to publicize your asset on social media. The *Back* icon and the *View
in Context* link return you to the Asset Publisher's default view.

## Enabling Tags, Categories, and Related Assets for Guestbooks

Since you've already asset-enabled guestbooks at the service layer, your
guestbook entities are all set to take advantage of Liferay's back-end support
for tags and categories. Your only remaining task is to update your user
interface allow access to these features. Recall that you've designed your
application to allow users to add guestbooks from two different portlets: the
Guestbook portlet and the Guestbook Admin portlet. In this section you'll update
the form on the Guestbook Admin portlet's `edit_guestbook.jsp` page to allow
users to add, edit, or remove tags and categories when adding or updating a
guestbook. For simplicity's sake, you'll leave the Guestbook portlet's
`edit_guestbook.jsp` page alone. (Of course, nothing is preventing you from
adding tags and categories functionality to the Guestbook portlet's
`edit_guestbook.jsp` except a design decision.)

Open your guestbook-portlet project's
`docroot/html/guestbookadmin/edit_guestbook.jsp` file. Replace the existing
contents with the following contents:

    <%@include file = "/html/init.jsp" %>

    <%
            Guestbook guestbook = null;

            long guestbookId = ParamUtil.getLong(request, "guestbookId");

            if (guestbookId > 0) {
                    guestbook = GuestbookLocalServiceUtil.getGuestbook(guestbookId);
            }
    %>

    <portlet:renderURL var="viewURL">
            <portlet:param name="mvcPath" value="/html/guestbookadmin/view.jsp"></portlet:param>
    </portlet:renderURL>

    <portlet:actionURL name='<%= guestbook == null ? "addGuestbook" : "updateGuestbook" %>' var="editGuestbookURL" />

    <aui:form action="<%= editGuestbookURL %>" name="<portlet:namespace />fm">
                    <aui:model-context bean="<%= guestbook %>" model="<%= Guestbook.class %>" />
                    
            <aui:fieldset>
                            <aui:input type="hidden" name="guestbookId"
                                    value='<%= guestbook == null ? "" : guestbook.getGuestbookId() %>' />
                            <aui:input name="name" />
            </aui:fieldset>
            
                    <liferay-ui:asset-categories-error />
                    <liferay-ui:asset-tags-error />
                    <liferay-ui:panel defaultState="closed" extended="<%= false %>" id="guestbookCategorizationPanel" persistState="<%= true %>" title="categorization">
                            <aui:fieldset>
                                    <aui:input name="categories" type="assetCategories" />

                                    <aui:input name="tags" type="assetTags" />
                            </aui:fieldset>
                    </liferay-ui:panel>

                    <liferay-ui:panel defaultState="closed" extended="<%= false %>" id="guestbookAssetLinksPanel" persistState="<%= true %>" title="related-assets">
                            <aui:fieldset>
                                    <liferay-ui:input-asset-links
                                            className="<%= Guestbook.class.getName() %>"
                                            classPK="<%= guestbookId %>"
                                    />
                            </aui:fieldset>
                    </liferay-ui:panel>

            <aui:button-row>
                            <aui:button type="submit"></aui:button>
                            <aui:button type="cancel" onClick="<%= viewURL %>"></aui:button>
            </aui:button-row>
    </aui:form>

Here, you're using Liferay and AUI JSP tags to add tags, categories, and related
assets to the form for adding or updating a guestbook. First, you add the
`<liferay-ui:asset-categories-error />` and `<liferay-ui:asset-categories-error
/>` tags to the form. These tags are responsible for displaying custom error
messages that appear if an error occurs with the categories or tags that are
submitted on the form. Next comes a `<liferay-ui:panel>` tag with several
attributes set. The `<liferay-ui:panel>` tag generates a collapsible section
inside which you add the input fields for tags and categories.

When using AUI, it's a best practice to add input fields inside of an
`<aui:fieldset>` tag. You do this with the following two tags:

    <aui:input name="categories" type="assetCategories" />
    <aui:input name="tags" type="assetTags" />

Specifying the `assetCategories` and `assetTags` types for these `<aui:input />`
tags tells Liferay that these input tags represent asset categories and asset
tags. Liferay shows the appropriate selectors for tags and categories and
displays the tags and categories that have already been added to the guestbook.

Inside of the second `<liferay-ui:panel>` tag is an `<aui:fieldset>` tag
containing a `<liferay-ui:asset-links>` tag. You have to specify values for the
`className` and `classPK` attributes in order for the correct asset links (the
related assets corresponding to the selected guestbook) to be displayed.

Test your updated `edit_guestbook.jsp` page by navigating to your Guestbook
Admin portlet in the Control Panel and clicking on *Add Guestbook*. You'll see a
field for adding tags and a selector for selecting related assets.

![Figure x: Once you've updated your Guestbook Admin portlet's `edit_guestbook.jsp` page, you'll see forms for adding tags and selecting related assets.](../../images/guestbook-tags-related-assets.png)

Where is the field for selecting categories? It's been enabled but it won't
appear until you create a vocabulary and add at least one category to it. Create
a sample vocabulary and add a few sample categories to this vocabulary. Then go
back to the Guestbook Admin portlet, click on *Add Guestbook* or *Actions*
&rarr; *Edit* next to a guestbook and confirm that categories are selectable.

You should also test the Related Assets feature. To do so, create a guestbook
and, say, a web content article. Then select one asset as a related asset of the
other and click *Save*. Or create two guestbooks and add one as a related asset
of the other.

+$$$

**Warning:** When you click on *Related Assets* from the Guestbook Admin
portlet's Add/Update Guestbook form, the fully qualified Java class name of your
entity appears in the list instead of just *Guestbook*. This is easy to fix by
adding a language hook to your guestbook-portlet project. See the [Language Hooks](www.liferay.com)
tutorial for details about creating language hooks.

$$$

Asset links represent a reciprocal relationship so if one asset is a related
asset of a second, the second is a related asset of the first. Check this for
the assets that you linked together.
