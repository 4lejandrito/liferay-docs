# Updating Your User Interface For Search

Updating the Guestbook portlet's user interface for search involves two steps:

1. Updating the Guestbook portlet's default view JSP to display a search bar
   which allows users to submit queries.

2. Creating a new JSP for the Guestbook portlet that reads the search query
   entered by the user and retrieves and displays search results.

You'll start by updating the Guestbook portlet's default view JSP.
