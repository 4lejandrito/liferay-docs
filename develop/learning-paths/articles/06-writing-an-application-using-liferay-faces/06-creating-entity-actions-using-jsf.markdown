# Creating Entity Actions Using JSF

To this point, you've created a JSF guestbook application that uses a database
to store its entries. Also, the application is integrated with Liferay's
permissions mechanism, allowing you to control who can access different parts of
the portlet. But what about managing the guestbook entries themselves? There is
currently no way to edit, delete, or set permissions on individual guestbook
entries. 

In this learning path, you'll create portlet actions to edit guestbook entries,
set permissions for entries, and delete entries. You'll use many of the same
concepts you've already been introduced to, like adding action methods to a
backing bean and adding buttons that trigger those methods using a JSF view.
