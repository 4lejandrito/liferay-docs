# Setting Permissions Using JSF

To this point, your guestbook portlet is able to create guestbooks and guestbook
entries and store them as data to you database. However, everyone that visits
your site has the ability to do this, which could present problems as an
administrator. Most of the time, you'll want some of the data in your guestbook
portlet protected from random users on the web. For instance, you may want to
enable some users to add guestbook entries, while preventing others from doing
so. 

In this learning path, you'll learn how to implement Liferay's permissions
system in your guestbook portlet following JSF best practices. The default
permissions scheme will allow users to view guestbooks and enter guestbook
entries, while preventing anonymous web-browsing users from doing either. Also,
regular users should not be allowed to add guestbooks, so you'll implement
permissions that only give administrators the ability to create new guestbooks.
You'll learn just how easy it is to implement security for a JSF application in
Liferay Portal, and transfer permissioning into your own applications.
