# Creating an Admin Portlet

To create the Guestbook Admin portlet, you'll use the New Liferay Portlet
wizard. You used this wizard in an earlier learning path when you created the
Guestbook portlet. The New Liferay Portlet wizard creates various required
configuration files such as `portlet.xml`, `liferay-portlet.xml`,
`liferay-display.xml`, and `liferay-plugin-package.properties` and adds
appropriate entries to them. The information that you specify in the wizard is
used to configure various entries in these configuration files and also
determines the names and locations of other required files such as the portlet
class and the location of the portlet's JSP files.
