# Beginning Liferay Development [](id=beginning-liferay-development-lp-6-2-develop-learnpath)

If you're just getting started with Liferay development, this is the place to
begin. We start at the beginning: installing a Liferay development environment.
Though you can use anything from a text editor and the command line to any Java
IDE that's out there, Liferay provides two development tools that make it easier
to write code on Liferay's platform. 

Liferay IDE and Liferay Developer Studio are virtually identical development
environments designed for creating Liferay projects. Both are based on Eclipse,
a widely used open source IDE that may already be familiar to you. 

If you're a Liferay Enterprise Edition subscriber or interested in Liferay's
premier development environment, begin with 
[Developing Applications with Liferay Developer Studio](/develop/learning-paths/-/knowledge_base/developing-applications-with-liferay-developer-stu-lp-6-2-develop-learnpath).

If you want to use Liferay's free development environment or want to leverage
it on top of an existing Eclipse installation, skip over to 
[Developing Applications with Liferay IDE](/develop/learning-paths/-/knowledge_base/developing-apps-with-liferay-ide-lp-6-2-develop-learnpath).
