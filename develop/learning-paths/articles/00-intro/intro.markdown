# Welcome [](id=welcome)

This is the place to come for an in-depth, from-the-ground-up guide to using
Liferay's development framework. Beginning with installing a Liferay development
environment, you'll learn everything in a step-by-step fashion from writing a
Liferay application, to customizing Liferay Portal, to distributing your
application in Liferay Marketplace. 

We call these guided tutorials Learning Paths, as they are designed to be
followed from beginning to end. If you follow them all, you'll have had a great
introduction to developing on Liferay's platform, and you'll be ready to delve
into the deeper topics found in the tutorials.
