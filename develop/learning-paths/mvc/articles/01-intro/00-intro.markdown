These guided tutorials are called Learning Paths since they are designed to be
followed from beginning to end. Following them all provides a great introduction
to developing on Liferay's platform. When you've finished following Liferay's
learning paths, you'll be prepared to dive into the more in-depths topics found
in the tutorials.
