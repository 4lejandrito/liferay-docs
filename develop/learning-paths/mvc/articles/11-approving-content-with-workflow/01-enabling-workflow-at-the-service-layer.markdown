<h1>Approving Content with Workflow</h1><p>In any application that accepts user created content, it&rsquo;s important to have an approval process for publishing that content. Review and approval might be necessary for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Preventing the posting of illegal data.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that no objectionable content, such as profanity, images, or any other violation of the terms of use, is published.</li>
  <li>Protecting the quality of published content.</li>
</ul><p>This learning path instructs the reader in workflow-enabling the Guestbook App&rsquo;s <code>Guestbook</code> and <code>Entry</code> entities, to ensure that only approved content is published after review.</p><p><img src="../../images/test-workflow-1.png" alt="Figure 1" /><p class="caption">Figure 1: Your custom entities can be workflow enabled, just like the core portal&rsquo;s entities.</p>
