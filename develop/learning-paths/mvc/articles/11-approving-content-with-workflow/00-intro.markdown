# Approving Content with Workflow

In any application that accepts user created content, it's important to have an
approval process for publishing that content. Review and approval might be
necessary for a number of reasons:

-Preventing the posting of illegal data
-Ensuring that no objectionable content, such as profanity, images, or any
other violation of the terms of use, is published. 
-Protecting the quality of published content. 

This learning path instructs the reader in workflow-enabling the Guestbook's
*Entry* entities, ensuring that guestbook entries are only published after
they're reviewed. As a bonus, you'll learn how to create custom workflow
definitions for use with your entities or any other workflow-enabled entities
in the portal.
