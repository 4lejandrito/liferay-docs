# Approving Content with Workflow

In any application that accepts user content, it's important to have an
approval process for publishing that content. Approval might be necessary for
preventing the posting of illegal data, ensuring that no objectionable content,
such as profanity, images, or any other violation of the terms of use, is
published, or simply protecting the quality of published content. This learning
path instructs the reader in workflow-enabling the Guestbook's *Entry* entities,
ensuring that guestbook entries are only published after they're reviewed. As a
bonus, you'll learn how to create custom workflow definitions
for use with your entities or any other workflow-enabled entities in the
portal.
