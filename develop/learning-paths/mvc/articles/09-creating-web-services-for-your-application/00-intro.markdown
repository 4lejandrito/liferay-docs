# Creating Web Services for Your Application

In this learning path, you'll use Service Builder to create remote web services
for the Guestbook application. When you're finished, authorized clients, such as
mobile devices, will be able to consume your application's web services. This
means that mobile application developers will be able to create apps which can
interact with your application. For example, Android or iOS developers could
create Guestbooks apps which allow users to view and add entries to your
Guestbook application from their smartphones or tablets. Developers should not
ignore today's mobile web, which is powered by lightweight clients that access
web services.
