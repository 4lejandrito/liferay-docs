# Retrieving and Displaying Portlet Data with the Mobile SDK

Using the Liferay Mobile SDK to retrieve and display portlet data is often the 
first piece of functionality to add in an app. If you followed along with the 
previous sections of this learning path, you should have a Liferay installation 
with a Guestbook portlet that contains a couple of guestbooks accompanying 
entries. You should also have an Android app with a Mobile SDK installed that 
can call the Guestbook portlet's remote services. Now it's time to put it all to 
use. After completing this segment of the learning path, you'll have an Android 
app capable of displaying the Guestbook portlet's contents. Now venture forth 
and fear no remote service!
