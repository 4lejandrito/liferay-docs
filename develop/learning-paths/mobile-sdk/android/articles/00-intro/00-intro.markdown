# Writing an Android Application with the Liferay Mobile SDK

Users often expect to access their portals from their mobile devices. As an 
intrepid developer, you naturally want to turn these expectations into reality. 
Wouldn't it be great if Liferay provided a way for your mobile apps to access 
portal content and applications? In fact, Liferay *does* provide this: the 
Liferay Mobile SDK! With it, you can call Liferay's built-in remote services as 
well as those of custom portlets. 

If you know something about how to develop Android apps, but need a start to 
finish guide on how to integrate them with the Liferay Mobile SDK, then you're 
in the right place. This learning path walks you through the creation of an 
Android app that interacts with the Guestbook portlet developed in the Liferay 
MVC learning path. When you're finished, you'll have an app that is able to do 
everything the Guestbook portlet is capable of. This includes adding, editing, 
and deleting Guestbooks and their entries. You'll even be able to use the Asset 
Framework features of the portlet.
