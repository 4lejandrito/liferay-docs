# Beginning Android Development with the Liferay Mobile SDK

Getting started with the Liferay Mobile SDK in your Android apps is fairly 
straightforward. This series of learning path articles walks you through the 
steps required to build and install the Liferay Mobile SDK in a Guestbook app 
that you'll use to leverage the functionality of the Guestbook portlet developed 
in the [Liferay MVC learning path](/learning-paths/-/knowledge_base/6-2/beginning-liferay-development). 
This screenshot shows how the initial Guestbook app should look when you're 
finished with this series of learning path articles:

Granted, this app won't yet display guestbooks and their entries from the 
portal, but it'll be primed and ready to do so. Now you're ready to get started!
