# Beginning Android Development with the Liferay Mobile SDK

Getting started with the Liferay Mobile SDK in your Android apps is fairly 
straightforward. This learning path walks you through the steps required to use 
the Mobile SDK in a Guestbook app that leverages the functionality of the 
Guestbook portlet developed in the Liferay MVC learning path. This screenshot 
shows how the Guestbook app should look when you're finished:

While this learning path provides complete code snippets of the app as it's 
developed, not every aspect of the Android code is explained in detail. Focus is 
instead placed on the code that leverages the Liferay Mobile SDK. Therefore, you 
should know at least the basics of Android app development before attempting 
this learning path. Without some knowledge of how Android apps are developed, 
you'll likely be lost here. Google provides extensive documentation of the 
Android APIs as well as some basic tutorials on [developer.android.com](http://developer.android.com/index.html).

It's also important to note that you needn't have completed the Liferay MVC 
learning path to obtain a working Guestbook portlet. You can download the 
complete portlet code [here on GitHub](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/tree/master/develop/learning-paths/mvc/code/learning-sdk/portlets). 
For instructions on building and deploying the portlet to your Liferay instance, 
see [this tutorial](/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/deploying-plugins-to-a-local-portal-instance).

Fantastic! Now you're ready to get started with Liferay's Mobile SDK!
