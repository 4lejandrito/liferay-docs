# Building the Liferay Mobile SDK

Once you've built and deployed the Guestbook portlet to your Liferay instance, 
you're ready to build the Liferay Mobile SDK. You might be asking yourself, "Why 
do I have to build it? Can't I just use the pre-built Mobile SDK that Liferay 
already provides?" Fantastic question! The reason is that this learning path 
calls the remote services of the Guestbook portlet, which is a custom portlet 
developed in the Liferay MVC learning path. The pre-built Mobile SDK provided by 
Liferay only includes remote service calls for Liferay's core portlets.
