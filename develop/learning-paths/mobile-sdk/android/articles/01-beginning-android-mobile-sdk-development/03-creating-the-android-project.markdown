# Creating the Android Project

Now that you've built the Liferay Mobile SDK for the Guestbook portlet, you're 
ready to create the Guestbook Android app. This article walks you through the 
steps required to create the app and install the Mobile SDK in it. After this, 
you'll be ready to leverage the service classes generated by the Mobile SDK for 
the Guestbook portlet. First though, you should make sure you've installed the 
Android development tools.

## Installing Android Studio

This learning path uses Android Studio to develop the Guestbook app. While it's 
possible to use Eclipse, Android Studio is used here because it's the official 
Android IDE. Use the following links to download, install, and get acquainted 
with Android Studio: 

- [Download Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
- [Android Studio Installation Instructions](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio)
- [Android Studio Overview](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html)

Once you get Android Studio up and running, you're ready to create the Guestbook 
app!

## Creating the Guestbook App

When you start Android Studio, a welcome screen with a Quick Start menu appears. 
Click *Start a new Android Studio project* in the Quick Start menu. Android 
Studio's *Create New Project* wizard launches and first asks you to fill in the 
*Application name*, *Company Domain*, and *Project location*. Enter 
*Liferay Guestbook* in the Application name field and *docs.liferay.com* in the 
Company Domain field. These fields are used to automatically fill in your app's 
*Package name* and *Project location*. Click *Next*.

The next screen of the wizard asks you to specify your app's form factors and 
the minimum supported Android SDK for each. Make sure that only the 
*Phone and Tablet* checkbox is selected. In the *Minimum SDK* menu, select 
*API 15: Android 4.0.3 (IceCreamSandwich)*.
