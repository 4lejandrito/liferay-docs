# Liferay Marketplace

The **Liferay Marketplace** is an exciting hub for sharing, browsing and
downloading Liferay-compatible applications. As enterprises look for ways to
build and enhance their existing platforms, developers and software vendors
search for new avenues to reach this market. Marketplace leverages the entire
Liferay ecosystem to release and share apps in a user-friendly, one-stop site. 

In addition to providing application consumers with Marketplace, Liferay
provides a Plugin Security Manager to help protect a consumer's portal from
potentially negative side-affects that can possibly be caused by an app. The
Plugin Security Manager's job is to only allow an app to use resources that the
app has specified up-front in its Portal Access Control List (PACL). As such,
we'll explain how to create PACLs for the apps you develop. 

This chapter covers to following topics related to developing apps for Liferay
